Asset
-----

Web assets, or also assets, is an encompassing term, that designates all essential elements necessary for the successful execution of a web-based project. Specifically, in the context of web design and development, these 'assets' pertain to diverse components, such as CSS, JS libraries, textual content, graphics, photographs, videos, and audio files.

Assets are often reduced to their URL, which might be hard coded or dynamically generated.
