.. _statement:

Statement
---------

A statement can be an assignment, a function call, a loop, a conditional statement or even a statement that does nothing (an empty statement). 

Statements usually end with a semicolon. 

In addition, statements can be grouped into a statement-group by encapsulating a group of statements with curly braces. A statement-group is a statement by itself as well.
