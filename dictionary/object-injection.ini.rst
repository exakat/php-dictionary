Object Injection
----------------

Object injection happens when a string is deserialized to recreate an object, inside PHP, while the string is controlled by the attacker.

The general synopsis is the following : 

+ PHP serialize an object
+ The serialized string is transmitted to the user, then back to PHP (via cookies, hidden fields, or any storage)
+ PHP deserialize the object

While in the hand of the user, the data was doctored to retain its format validity, but with values that are now controlled by the attacker.
