And Operator
------------

``and`` is the logical operator: it returns ``true`` only when both operands are ``true``; otherwise, it returns ``false``. 

It is synonym with the symbol and operator ``&&``, though it has a different precedence level. 

There is also a bitwise ``and`` operator: ``&``

``and`` is a PHP keyword.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $a = 1 && 2;
   
   ?>
