Escape Data
-----------

Escaping data is a method to write data in a neutral syntax for a target technology. 

For example, angular brackets and quotes are special characters for HTML : to display them without their actual HTML meaning, they have to be escaped as HTML entities, such as &quote or &gt;. 

Escaping applies to technologies which mix raw strings and executable expression : SQL, CSV, HTML, LDAP, etc. 

Escaping data replace some symbols with a longer sequence of symbols. The escaping is made with a special character, which must itself be escaped. For example, CSV escapes anti-slash with a double anti-slash.

PHP supports escape sequences for characters in a string. This is the same concept of escaping data : there, the target includes portability.
