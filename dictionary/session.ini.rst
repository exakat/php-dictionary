Session
-------

Session support in PHP consists of a way to preserve certain data across subsequent accesses to the web server. 

By default, each query to a webserver is independent from the others. With session, it is possible to keep some data on the server, and retrieve them at each access.

It relies on the ``session_*`` functions, and the ``$_SESSION`` superglobal variable.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   if (isset($_SESSION['x'])) {
       print "x was already set with the value ".$_SESSION['x'];
   }
   
   $_SESSION['x'] = rand(0, 10);
   print "Giving the value ".$_SESSION['x']." to x, in the session\n";
   
   ?>
