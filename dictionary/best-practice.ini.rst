Best Practices
--------------

Best practices, or also called good practices, are rules and guidelines that are known to produce a desirable outcome. 

For example, 'comment the code', 'use meaningful names' and 'optimisation is the root of all evil' are such rules. 

Best practices are often grouped in a ruleset, such as SOLID, DRY or Calisthenics. 

It takes some effort to understand the value of the rules, without running into the errors they protect against.
