Dynamic Constant
----------------

A constant is dynamic when its name is in a variable, or another container, and is accessed at execution time. 

Reaching a constant's value is done by using the constant() function, or the dynamic constant fetch with classes. 

Sometimes, dynamic constants are also called variable constants.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   const A = 1;
   // simple case
   $a = 'A';
   echo constant($a); // displays 1
   
   // with leading backslash
   $b = '\A';
   echo constant($b); // displays 1
   
   // definition has no leading backslash
   define('B\C', d);
   // reading has no leading backslash, or not
   $c = '\b\C';
   echo constant($c); // displays d
   $c = 'b\C';
   echo constant($c); // displays d
   
   // constant() works also on class constants.
   class D {
       const E = 'f';
   }
   echo constant('d::E'); // displays f
   
   // dynamic constant access on classes or enumeration
   $k = 'E';
   echo D::{$k}; // f
   
   // constant works also on enumeration cases
   enum I: string {
       case G = 'h';
   }
   echo constant('I::G')->value; // displays h
   
   // dynamic constant access on classes or enumeration
   $g = 'G';
   echo I::{$g}->value; // h
   
   ?>
