Version
-------

In the context of software development, a version refers to a specific iteration or release of a software product or application. It represents a distinct point in the evolution of the software, marking a milestone or set of changes made to the codebase.

Versions are typically assigned using a versioning scheme that helps track and identify different releases. Versions may be sequential, date based or semantic.

Versions serve several purposes : tracking changes, Compatibility management, Release management and Bug tracking and support.
