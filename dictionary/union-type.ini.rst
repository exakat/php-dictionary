Union Type
----------

Union types refer to the ability to specify multiple possible types for a property, parameter, or return value. It allows a property or parameter to accept values of different types. It allows a method or function to return values of different types. Union types were introduced in PHP 8.

Before PHP 8, type declaration could only have a single type declaration, except for the null type. Nowadays, with union types, the code can declare multiple types by separating them with a pipe (|) symbol. 

Union types were introduced for exception catching, before PHP 8.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class x {
       private A | B | C $property;
   }
   
   try {
   
   } catch (A|B|C $e) {
   
   }
   
   ?>
