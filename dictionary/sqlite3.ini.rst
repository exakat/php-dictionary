Sqlite3
-------

SQLite is a C-language library that implements a small, fast, self-contained, high-reliability, full-featured, SQL database engine.

The related extension is Sqlite3. It allows the creation and usage of file-based or memory-based databases.

Sqlite3 is also available with PDO (Portable Document File), with the pdo_sqlite engine.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   $db = new SQLite3('my.sqlite3');
   
   $results = $db->query('SELECT bar FROM foo');
   while ($row = $results->fetchArray()) {
       var_dump($row);
   }
   ?>
