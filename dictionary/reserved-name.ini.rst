Reserved Names
--------------

PHP shares several namespaces with the custom code, and has reserved some names for its own usage. 

+ Namespaces : the global namespace, also known as ``\`` is reserved for PHP.
+ Keywords : ``fn``, ``finally``, ``insteadof``, ``null``, ``void``, ``match``, ...
+ some classes, constants, functions, interfaces: ``die``, ``exit``, 
+ variables : ``$GLOBALS``, ``$_GET``,...



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // function void() would not compile
   function theVoid() : bool { }
   
   ?>
