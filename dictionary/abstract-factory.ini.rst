Abstract Factory
----------------

An Abstract Factory is a design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

It is one level of abstraction above the simple factory pattern. While a simple factory creates one type of object, an abstract factory is used to create a set of related factories, each responsible for creating a family of products.
