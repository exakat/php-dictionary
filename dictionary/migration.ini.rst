Migration
---------

Migration is the incremental upgrade of a piece of code. 

It is often used for databases, for example, with Laravel database migrations; for components and frameworks : for example, CakePHP migration.

Usually, migration requires some action from the user, although a migration script may be provided.

Migration may also be called upgrades.
