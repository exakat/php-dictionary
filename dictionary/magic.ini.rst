Magic
-----

Magic is mostly used in the sentence : 'There is too much magic in this code'. It usually refers to convention which triggers certain behavior, which is not explicit in the code, but rather documented and learnt. 

Magic has only a remote relationship to PHP's magic constant and magic methods.
