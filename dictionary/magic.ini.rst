Magic
-----

Magic is mostly used in the sentence : 'There is too much magic in this code'. It usually refers to conventions which trigger certain behaviors, though they are not explicit in the code, but rather documented and learnt. 

Magic has only a remote relationship to PHP's magic constants, magic numbers and magic methods.
