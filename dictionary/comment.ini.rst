Comments
--------

PHP comments are used to add explanatory notes or annotations within your code. Comments are not executed by the PHP interpreter; they are purely for documentation purposes, and they help you and others understand the code better. PHP supports two main types of comments:

Single-line comments: these are comments that span only one line. They are typically used for brief explanations or annotations within the code. Single-line comments in PHP can be created using either double slashes (``//``) or a hash symbol (``#``).

Multi-line comments: these are comments that can span multiple lines, allowing for more extensive explanations or commenting out large sections of code. Multi-line comments in PHP are enclosed within ``/*`` and ``*/``.

It's important to note that comments do not affect the execution of the PHP code; they are ignored by the PHP interpreter: in fact, they are removed before execution. Comments are primarily for developers and maintainers of the code to understand its purpose, logic, or any special considerations. Well-documented code with meaningful comments can make it easier for you and others to read, understand, and maintain PHP applications.

Comments may be formalized with a specific syntax, and create automated instruction for other application. For example, phpdoc comments are providing extra information with a specific syntax.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // This is a single-line comment
   $variable = 42; // Assign a value to $variable
   # Another single-line comment
   
       /*
       This is a multi-line comment.
       It can span multiple lines and is often used for
       longer explanations or for commenting out sections of code.
       */
   
       $variable = 43; 
   
   ?>
