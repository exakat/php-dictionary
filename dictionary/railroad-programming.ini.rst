Railroad Programming
--------------------

Railroad programming is a functional programming paradigm that manage flow control, especially success vs failure, without messy if/else chains or exceptions everywhere.

The image comes from the sequence of step, expressed as a train track : one rail links the different successes, while the other rail links all the failures. It is possible to go from success to failure.
