Handle
------

A handle, in PHP jargon, represents a datastructure that has established a link with an independent resource. There are handles for files, for database connection, for http connections, etc.

The content of the handle is usually opaque: there is no need to know what is inside, except that this handle must be provided to every function call.

Handles are often build with the type ``resource``, and they are evolving toward objects. The content is still opaque, but the objects carry the dataset between method calls.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $handle = fopen(c:\\folder\\resource.txt, r);
   $string = fread($handle);
   fclose($handle);
   
   ?>
