Email
-----

Email, short for electronic mail, is a method of exchanging digital messages between people using electronic devices. These messages can contain text, attachments, images, and other multimedia elements. Email is a widely used communication tool for both personal and professional purposes.

PHP can send emails with the ``mail()`` function. PHP doesn't receive emails, as it requires a server, so it relies on the ``imap`` extension. 

PHP also offers special filter to validate email addresses, with the filter extension.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $to = destination@example.com;
   $subject = Test Email;
   $message = This is a test email.;
   
   // Send the email
   mail($to, $subject, $message);
   
   ?>
