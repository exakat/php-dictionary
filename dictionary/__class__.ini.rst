__CLASS__
---------

``__CLASS__`` holds the current class name: this is class of definition, not the called class. It is not the same as ``self::class``, which may change depending on the calling context.

The class name includes the namespace it was declared in (e.g. ``N\X``). 

When used inside a trait method, ``__CLASS__`` is the name of the class the trait is used in.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   namespace N; 
   
   class X {
       function foo() {
           echo __CLASS__;
       }
   }
   
   ?>
