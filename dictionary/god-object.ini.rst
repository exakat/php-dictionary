God Object
----------

A ``god object`` is a term used in software development to describe a class or module that knows too much or does too much within a system. It typically refers to an object that has an excessive amount of responsibilities, making it overly complex and difficult to maintain. In other words, a god object violates the principles of encapsulation and high cohesion.
