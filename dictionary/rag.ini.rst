Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
------------------------------------

Retrieval Augmented Geenration, aka RAG, is a technique used in artificial intelligence, especially in large language models, to improve the accuracy and relevance of generated responses.

RAG is widely used in chatbots, search engines, and knowledge management systems to provide better, more reliable answers.
