Mixed
-----

A special type that represents any available type. It is equivalent to not explicitly setting the type, though it is now explicitly done. 

A ``mixed`` type may be also represented by a union of all possible types. 

``mixed`` is useful when literally any type should be supported, such as with a cache system. Yet, it is usually recommended to consider reducing the number of possible types by using a common interface or a union type. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   function cache(string $name, mixed $value) : bool {
   	static $cache = [];
   	
   	$cache[$name] = $value;
   	
   	return true;
   }
   ?>
