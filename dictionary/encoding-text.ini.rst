Text Encoding
-------------

Encoding is the way characters are organized to hold a meaning while being transmitted, stored or manipulated. 

Encoding applies to PHP scripts, which should be UTF-8 encoded, although it might support other formats.

Encoding applies to incoming and outgoing data.

Encoding operations are provided with ``ext/mbstring``, ``ext/iconv`` and ``ext/intl`` extensions. 

Encoding is also used for code : the source is encoded when it is transformed in an unreadable yet still executable form. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   $text = "This is the Euro symbol 'â‚¬'.";
   
   echo 'Original : ', $text, PHP_EOL;
   echo 'TRANSLIT : ', iconv("UTF-8", "ISO-8859-1//TRANSLIT", $text), PHP_EOL;
   echo 'IGNORE   : ', iconv("UTF-8", "ISO-8859-1//IGNORE", $text), PHP_EOL;
   echo 'Plain    : ', iconv("UTF-8", "ISO-8859-1", $text), PHP_EOL;
   
   ?>
