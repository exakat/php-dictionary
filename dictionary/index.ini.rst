Index
-----

An index may be several things: 

+ An identifier in an array
+ A optimized datastructure for a database, SQL or key-value store
+ A optimized datastructure for fast search operations

An indexed array is an array whose index are integers. This distinguish them from the associative arrays, whose keys are strings.
