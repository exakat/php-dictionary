Neutral Element
---------------

A neutral element is an piece of data which has no effect with a particular operation.

For example, ``0`` is the neutral element for the addition, as ``0 + $a`` is the same as ``$a + 0`` and the same as ``$a`` (without any type change).

The neutral element for the multiplication is ``1``; the neutral element for the concatenation is the empty string ``''``. 

It is usually possible to define a neutral element for any operation or method call. For objects, they are call null object, as they could replace the ``null`` scalar value.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $a = 10;
   
   $a *= 1; // this does nothing
   $a += 1; // this does nothing
   
   ?>
