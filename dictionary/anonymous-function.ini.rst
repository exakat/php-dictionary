Anonymous Function
------------------

A function may be instantiated, without defining a function name. Such functions are called anonymous. 

In PHP, they are defined as closures or arrow functions. They may also be created based on existing methods and functions, with the `...` operator.

Even without names, they are usable just like functions, or as callable. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   	$closure = function () {} ; 
   
   	$arrowFunction = fn() => 1;
   	
   	$fcs = strlen(...);
   ?>
