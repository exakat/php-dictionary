Prefix
------

A prefix is a word extension, placed before the name. 

In linguistics, prefixes change the meaning of the word, and give it a new built meaning, based on the meanings of the word and the prefix. For example, ``reconnect`` is build with ``re``, which means again, and ``connect`` which means connect (sic). Reconnect is the action to connect again, after a previous connection was lost.

In PHP, prefixes are used for convention, where methods built with prefixes should deliver a specific behavior. 

+ ``get``: access a value
+ ``set``: assign a value
+ ``with``: use an option to apply a process
+ ``find``: search for a value, and may fail if there are none
+ ``parse``: analyzer a piece of data to understand it
etc. 

In older PHP version, prefixing variables used to hold the type of the variable.

A similar notion is the suffix, which is located at the end of the word. Another way to create word is word combinaison.
