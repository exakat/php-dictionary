Bucket
------

The term ``bucket`` is not commonly associated with a specific concept. In a more general sense, the term ``bucket`` is often used in the context of data structures and algorithms to refer to a container or a storage space for holding elements.

For example, in the context of hashing or hash tables, a ``bucket`` may be used to describe the individual storage locations where key-value pairs are stored. When a hash collision occurs (two keys hash to the same location), the elements with the same hash value are often placed in a bucket, which is a data structure that allows multiple elements to be stored at the same location.
