Query
-----

Query is a generic term in PHP. It refers to a command, written in a specific format, and that is processed by a separate engine. 

Hence, query has several usages: 

+ SQL query, when sending command to a SQL server. This is possibly the most common usage. 
+ The query string, a part of the URL
+ HTTP query, when processing or submitting command via HTTP
+ LDAP query, when communicating with a LDAP server
