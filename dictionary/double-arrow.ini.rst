Double Arrow
------------

The double arrow is the PHP token ``=>``. It is an arrow, and the equal sign as body of the arrow gives it its name of double arrow.

The double arrow is used in several situations: 

+ With arrow functions: ``fn($a) => $a + 1;``
+ In arrays, to distinguish the key from the value: ``['a' => 3]``
+ In list, to distinguish the key from the value: ``list('a' => $b) = ['a' => 4]``
+ In yield, to distinguish the key from the value: ``yield 'a' => $b;``
+ In property hooks, to start the body of the hook: ``private $p { get => $this->p; }``.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $array = ['a' => 3, 3];
   
   ?>
