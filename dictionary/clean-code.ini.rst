Clean Code
----------

Clean code refers to code that is well-organized, easy to read, and easy to maintain. It follows best practices and principles that contribute to the overall quality of the codebase. Clean code is not just about functionality but also about readability, simplicity, and maintainability. It is a concept introduced by Robert C. Martin in his book 'Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship'.
