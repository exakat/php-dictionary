Literal Types
-------------

Literal types are type which not only check the type of a value but also the value itself. PHP has support for two literal types: false as of PHP 8.0.0, and true as of PHP 8.2.0. 

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // bool is a type
   // false is a literal type : a bool, which value is false
   function foo(bool $a) : false {
   	return false;
   }
   
   ?>
