Functional Programming
----------------------

Functional Programming (FP) is a programming paradigm where programs are built by combining pure functions, avoiding shared state, and minimizing side effects. Instead of focusing on 'how to do things' step by step, FP focuses on 'what to compute' by composing functions.

PHP supports anonymous functions, closures, iterators and higher-order functions, needed for Functional programming.
