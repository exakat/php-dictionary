Array Append
------------

Append is an array operation, which adds an element at the end of the array. It is also called a push.

There are two operators for this feature ; the ``[]`` operator, which has to be placed after a variable or member. There is also the array_push() function, which is available as a callback, unlike the operator.

The opposite operation is a pop, with the function array_pop(). Array_unshift() is the append at the beginning of the array. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $array = [1, 2, 3];
   $array[] = 4;
   
   $array []= 5; // Same as above, with a notation similar to a short assignation
   
   array_push($array, 6);
   
   // $array === [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
   ?>
