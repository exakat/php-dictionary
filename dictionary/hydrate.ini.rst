Hydratation
-----------

To hydrate is to fill an object with data coming from an unstructured format, before using it. This happens when reading data from a database, a dataset, or from the incoming superglobals.

Hydration is quite repetitive, as the source data must be mapped to the corresponding property. Validation may also play a part in that operation.
