Anonymous Constant
------------------

A constant may be anonymous. In that case, it is reduced to its value, and it is a literal. 

There is no explicit code for an anonymous constant: it is the simple application of the concept to an existing structure.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   	// a constant
   	const A = 'abc';
   	
   	// an anonymous constant
   	'def';
   
   ?>
