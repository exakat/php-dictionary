OOP (Object Oriented Programming)
---------------------------------

Procedural Programming is a programming paradigm where a program is structured as a series of step-by-step instructions, using procedures (functions) and control flow statements like loops, conditionals, and function calls. It focuses on \what to do next\, in a sequential, top-down manner.

PHP supports functions and global variables needed for Functional programming.

A lot of legacy PHP code is written in a procedural style. It usually evolved to OOP, Object Oriented Programming.
