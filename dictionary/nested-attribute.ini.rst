Nested Attributes
-----------------

Arguments of attributes may be literals, such as integer or strings: they can also be other objects. 

This feature was introduced in PHP 8.1. The objects must be created with a new expression, with their respective argument position or name. The created object is not necessarily an attribute itself, and they may also be created with another new expression.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   #[
       MyAttribute(
           new OptionA('a'),
           new OptionB(new OptionC(), 3)
       )
   ]
   function headers() : never {
   }
   
   ?>
