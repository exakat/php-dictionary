Naming
------

`naming` refers to the process of choosing appropriate names for variables, functions, classes, constants, traits, interfaces, enum, methods, parameters and  any other programming elements. 

Good naming practices are essential for writing readable, maintainable, and understandable code. Clear and meaningful names make it easier for developers (including yourself) to understand the purpose and functionality of different parts of the codebase.
