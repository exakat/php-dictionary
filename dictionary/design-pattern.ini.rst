Design Pattern
--------------

A design pattern, or simply a pattern, is a general solution to a common problem. Design patterns also get a name, for easy reference. 

Common design patterns in PHP (this list is not exhaustive) : 

+ Factory
+ Dependency injection
+ Decorator
+ Module
+ Iterators

Design patterns are not dedicated to PHP, though most of them do apply to PHP.
