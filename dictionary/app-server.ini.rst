Application Server
------------------

An application server in the context of PHP is a software environment that handles the execution of PHP scripts, serving dynamic content and managing interactions between the web server, the backend systems (like databases), and the client (browser or API consumer).

While PHP itself runs as an interpreted scripting language, the application server facilitates tasks like processing requests, managing resources, and sometimes handling session state or authentication.
