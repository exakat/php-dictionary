Pipe Operator
-------------

The ``pipe`` operator is the ``|>`` operator. 

The pipe operator chains two callables from left to right: it takes the return value of the first callable and passes it to the right callable.

The pipe operator is equivalent to nested calls of functions, methods, closures. It also only applies to callables with one compulsory parameter, with return values, and without references.

It was added in PHP 8.5.

The pipe operator is a reference to the ``|`` pipe operator from the command line, with use the result of the previous (left) command to feed the next (right) command. It should not be confused with the or operator ``|``, already available.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $result = HELLO world
       |> trim(...)
       |> strtolower(...)
       |> ucfirst(...);
   // Hello World
   
   
   // Same as 
   $result = ucfirst(strtolower(trim(HELLO World)));
   // Hello World
   
   ?>
