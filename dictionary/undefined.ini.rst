Undefined
---------

Something ``undefined`` has not been defined yet. The definition may vary from structure to structure: a variable is created upon its first writing, while a class needs a declaration.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // class x is defined, or declared
   class x {}
   
   // variable $y is undefined
   echo $y;
   
   ?>
