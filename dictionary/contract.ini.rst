Design By Contract (DBC)
------------------------

Design by Contract (DbC) is a software development approach that focuses on specifying the expected behavior of software components through preconditions, postconditions, and invariants. Although DbC is not natively supported in PHP, any application may incorporate its principles into your PHP code using libraries and coding practices.
