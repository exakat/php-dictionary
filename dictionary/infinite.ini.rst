Infinite
--------

Infinite means that an operation is repeated and will never stop being repeated. 

Infinite is characteristics of loops, generators, recursive functions and streams. Infinite structures may be a bug or a feature, depending on the usage. For example, the event loop is usually an infinite loop, until one of the event triggers a jump out of the loop.

Infinite is also a PHP constant: ``INF``. 

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // infinite loops
   while(true) { }
   
   for(;;) {} 
   
   // infinite generator 
   function integers() {
       $i = 0;
       while(true) {
           yield $i++;
       }
   }
   
   // infinite Fibbonacci sequence
   function recursive ($a = 1, $b = 1) {
       $a2 = $b;
       $b2 = $a + $b;
       print $b2.PHP_EOL;
       recursive($a2, $b2);
   }
   
   ?>
