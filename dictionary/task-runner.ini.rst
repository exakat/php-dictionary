Task Runner
-----------

A task runner refers to a tool or framework that automates repetitive tasks, such as building, testing, and deploying PHP applications. It helps streamline development workflows by reducing manual effort and increasing efficiency.

Task runners provide a way to define and execute tasks or scripts in a predefined sequence, often using configuration files or scripts. These tasks can include various activities, such as compiling code, running tests, optimizing assets, generating documentation, and deploying the application to a server.
