Dynamic
-------

Dynamic is a common concept in PHP, and may be used in three distinct situations: 

+ dynamic call, to call a function or method whose name is in a variable
+ dynamic constant, to call a constant whose name is in a variable
+ dynamic property, to access a property whose name is in a variable
+ dynamic loading, for PHP to load an extension after the start of execution
+ dynamic variable, to access a variable whose name is in another variable.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // Dynamic call of a variable
   $a = K;
   $x = 'a';
   echo $$x; // K
   
   const A = 1;
   $name = 'A';
   echo constant($name); // 1
   
   ?>
