Dynamic
-------

Dynamic is a common concept in PHP, and may be used in three distinct situations: 

+ dynamic call, to call a function or method whose name is in a variable
+ dynamic constant, to call a constant whose name is in a variable
+ dynamic property, to access a property whose name is in a variable
+ dynamic loading, for PHP to load an extension after the start of execution
+ dynamic variable, to access a variable whose name is in another variable
