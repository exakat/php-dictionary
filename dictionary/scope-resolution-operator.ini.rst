Scope Resolution Operator ::
----------------------------

The Scope Resolution Operator is a token that allows access to static, constant, and overridden properties or methods of a class.

Traditionally, this used to be a feature of the function get_class(). The operator is more modern and faster. 

The double colon operator is used to access class related elements, such as 

+ static properties, ``X::$property``
+ static methods, ``X::method()``
+ static constants, ``X::CONSTANT``,
+ class name, ``X::class``

This operator is often called double-colon, or ``paamayim-nekudotayim`` : this means ``double-colon`` in Hebrew. It is said to be a lot easier to google than ``::``.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $a = new stdClass();
   
   echo $a::class;
   
   // identical to 
   echo get_class($a);
   
   ?>
