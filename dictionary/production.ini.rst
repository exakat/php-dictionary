Production
----------

In web development and IT infrastructure, the term "Production" refers to the environment or set of servers where the final, fully functional version of an application is deployed and actively running for real users or a live audience. This environment is public-facing, meaning any bugs, performance issues, or downtime directly affect actual end-users. It is distinct from development, testing, or staging environments, as its main purpose is to serve live traffic and real business operations. Proper monitoring, security, and optimization are critical in production environments to ensure reliability and performance.
