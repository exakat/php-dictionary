Coverage
--------

The coverage is the concept that an operation has been applied to every part of a whole body. 

PHP uses this notion with test, where code coverage is expected to use as much as possible of the code; and type coverage, where as many types as possible have been applied.

Usually, coverage refers to code coverage.
