Stealth Generator
-----------------

A function becomes a generator as soon as the ``yield`` keyword is added to the block of code. At that point, the function may be called, but it won't do anything until the ``yield`` are executed. The code continue its execution, though.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   function foo() {
       print a;
       yield 2;
       print b;
   }
   
   foo();
   print c;
   
   ?>
