Depth
-----

Depth is a measure of how many an operation has been repeatedly applies, over and over. 

It applies to several concepts: 

+ multi-dimensional array depth: ``$array['d1']['d2']['d3']['d4']``
+ recursion depth: see example
+ nested loop depth: number of loops inside a loop
+ callstack depth: number of functions calling another one
+ object inheritance depth: the maximum number of extension levels in a class hierarchy

Depth might be limited, when it is prevented from going beyond a certain level, or unlimited, when there is no such limit. For example, xdebug offers a directive called ``xdebug.max_nesting_level`` that limits nesting depth.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // The recursion depth is limited to 5
   function foo($level = 0) { 
       if ($level < 5) { 
           return foo($level + 1);
       } 
       return 1;
   }
   ?>
