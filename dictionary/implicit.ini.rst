Implicit
--------

A feature is implicit when it is available, yet not visible. 

For example, objects are passed by reference to functions: any change applied to that object, inside the function, is also available in the calling context.

Until PHP 8.4, it was possible to assign ``null`` as a default value to any typed parameter: ``null`` was implicitely an accepted type for that value. 

The contrary to implicit is explicit. This notion share similarities with hidden features and collateral features.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   function foo($object) {
       $object->p = 1;
   }
   
   $object = new stdClass();
   foo($object);
   echo $object->p; 
   
   ?>
