Condition
---------

Conditions are an expression that are either true or false. 

They are used in conditional statement, to determine which code to process next. 

There are conditions in conditional statements, such as if(), switch() and match(). There are conditions in loops, to determine if the loop shall continue or not : in for(), do-while() and while().  

Conditions in PHP are expressed with comparisons operators. They are also expressed with raw data, which are converted to boolean, thanks to type-juggling.
