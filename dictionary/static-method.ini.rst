Static Method
-------------

Static methods are methods defined with the static keyword. They have to be called with the name of the class, rather than instantiated object. 

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class x {
       static function foo() {
           echo __METHOD__;
       }
   }
   
   //displays x::foo
   x::foo();
   
   ?>
