$_FILES
-------

In PHP, the ``$_FILES`` variable is a special superglobal variable that is used to retrieve information about files uploaded to the server via HTML forms with the ``enctype="multipart/form-data"`` attribute. It provides access to the uploaded file's properties such as name, size, type, and temporary location on the server.

When a file upload form is submitted, PHP populates the ``$_FILES`` variable with an array structure that contains information about the uploaded files. The array is organized based on the input field names used in the form.

+ ``$_FILES['userfile']['name']`` : the original name of the file on the client machine.
+ ``$_FILES['userfile']['type']`` : the mime type of the file, if the browser provided this information. An example would be "image/gif". This mime type is however not checked on the PHP side and therefore don't take its value for granted.
+ ``$_FILES['userfile']['size']`` : the size, in bytes, of the uploaded file.
+ ``$_FILES['userfile']['tmp_name']`` : the temporary filename of the file in which the uploaded file was stored on the server.
+ ``$_FILES['userfile']['error']`` : the error code associated with this file upload.
+ ``$_FILES['userfile']['full_path']`` : the full path as submitted by the browser. This value does not always contain a real directory structure, and cannot be trusted. Available as of PHP 8.1.0.

``$_FILES`` is associated to the functions move_uploaded_file() and is_uploaded_file().


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
       // $a->file was filled with $_FILES at some point
       move_uploaded_file($a->file['tmp_name'], $target);
   
   ?>
