Use
---

The use operator has three distinct usages. 

The use operator allows the import and aliasing of fully qualified names (such as classes, interfaces, constants, ...)  in the current namespace. 

When `use` used inside a class or a trait, it imports a trait and its methods and properties. It is also the place to solve naming conflicts.

When `use` is used with a closure, it imports the listed variables in the closure, from the defining environment.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   namespace \My\Space {
       // class importation with use
       use \Some\Other\Space\aClass as A;
       
       class B {
           // trait importation of use
           use MyTrait; 
       
           function foo() {
               $a = 1;
               // use imports the variable $a in the closure. Its value is accessible at execution time.
               $closure = function ($b) use ($a) { return $a + $b;}
           }
       }
       // class importation with use
       use \Some\Other\Space\aClass as A;
       
   }
   
   ?>
