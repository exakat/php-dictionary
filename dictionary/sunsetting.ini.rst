Sunsetting
----------

Sunsetting a feature is a period of deprecation, where the feature is still available, but is not recommended for usage. It is also displaying a warning message to alert of the disappearance, and offers alternatives.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   //Deprecated: foo(): Implicitly marking parameter $i as nullable is deprecated, the explicit nullable type must be used instead 
   function foo(int $i = null) {}
   
   ?>
