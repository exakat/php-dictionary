Forum
-----

A forum is a web application that allows users to hold structured discussions online.

A forum (also called a discussion board) is software where users can:

+ create discussion topics
+ post replies
+ organize conversations into categories
+ interact through comments, reactions, or private messages

It’s one of the earliest and most common types of PHP web applications.

PHP has a lot of forums. Here is a list: 

+ ``phpBB <https://www.phpbb.com/>``_
+ ``MyBB <https://mybb.com/>``_
+ ``Flarum <https://flarum.org/>``_
+ ``Simple Machines Forum (SMF) <https://www.simplemachines.org/>``_
+ ``XenForo <https://xenforo.com/>``_
+ ``PunBB <https://punbb.informer.com/>``_
+ ``ElkArte <https://www.elkarte.net/>``_.
