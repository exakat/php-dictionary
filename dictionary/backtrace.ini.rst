Backtrace
---------

A backtrace, in PHP and in other programming language, is a snapshot of the callstack at a specific point in the program’s execution. This is typically needed when an error or exception occurs.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   function foo() {
       goo();
   }
   
   function goo() {
       debug_print_backtrace();
   }
   
   foo();
   
   /**
   #0 /in/a4eQc(3): goo()
   #1 /in/a4eQc(10): foo()
   */
   
   ?>
