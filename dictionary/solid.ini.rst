SOLID
-----

SOLID is an acronym for a set of OOP design principle. They were coined by Robert C. Martin (also known as Uncle Bob).

+ S : Single Responsibility Principle
+ O : Open Closed Principle
+ L : Liskov Substitution Principle
+ I : Interface Segregation Principle
+ D : Dependency Inversion Principle

Each principle may be used independently. Those principles are not dedicated to PHP, though they are used with PHP.
