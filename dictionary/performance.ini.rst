Performance
-----------

Performance refers to the speed of execution, or, to a lesser extend, to the economy of resources used. 

The speed of execution is the time it takes for a task to be completed, and usually, the faster the better. In that context, there is a distinction between unit performance and parallel performances, where several instances are executed at the same time. 

The performance of a piece of code may cover its memory consumption, or any other constraint resource.
