Jump
----

A jump typically refers to any non-linear control flow, where the program skips from one part of the code to another. In fact, it is bypassing the normal sequential execution.

There are a few constructs in PHP that qualify as jumps: ``goto``, ``break``, ``continue``, ``yield``, ``yield from``, ``throw``, ``return``.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   function foo(int $a) {
       // jumps out of the method
       if ($a > 10) { return; }
       
       foreach(range(1, 10) as $i) {
           if (doSomething($i, $a)) {
               // jumps out of the loop
               break 1; 
           }
       }
       
       // normal execution
       return $a + 1;
   }
   
   ?>
