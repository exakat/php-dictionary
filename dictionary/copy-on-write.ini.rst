Copy On Write
-------------

``Copy on write`` is a data management technic where data is shared between contexts, until is is actually modified. When a modification happens, the data is then duplicated, to avoid polluting the original data. Otherwise, simple reads keep the data intact, and save a copy operation and memory. 

PHP uses this technic for arrays and strings, unless they are passed by reference. It is totally transparent for the code.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $array = [1,2,3];
   
   function foo($a) {
       echo $a[1]; // 
       
       $a[2] = 4; // $a is copied, then modified.
   }
   
   ?>
