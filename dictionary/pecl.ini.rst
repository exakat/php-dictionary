PHP Extension C Library (PECL)
------------------------------

PECL is a repository for PHP Extensions, providing a directory of all known extensions and hosting facilities for downloading and development of PHP extensions.

Since 2024, PECL is being replaced by ``PIE``.

``PECL`` is pronounced ``pickle``.
