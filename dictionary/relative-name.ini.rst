Relative Name
-------------

A relative name is a name that is completed by the current namespace to lead to the definition of the referenced structure.

Relative names usually start without the leading ``\``. In the case of names with a single name, it is either a relative name, or a local import.

The opposite of relative name is absolute name.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   namespace B\A {
       function B() {}
       
       class C {}
   
   }
   
   namespace B {
       use A\B as C;
       //import 
       new C();
   
       // relative name
       new A\C(); // actually calls B \ A\C
   }
   
   ?>
