Datastack
---------

A data stack is a LIFO data structure: the last data added to the stack is the first to get out.

In PHP, a data stack may be implemented with an array, and the ``array_push()`` (or ``$array[]`` operator) and the ``array_pop()`` functions. 

There is also a class called ``SplStack``, in the ``spl`` extension, and ``Ds\Stack`` in the ``ds`` extension.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $stack = [];
   $stack[] = first;
   $stack[] = second;
   // same as array_push($stack, second);
   
   echo array_pop($stack); // Outputs: second
   
   ?>
