Sign
----

A signed expression is an expression that starts with the ``+`` or the ``-`` token. 

``+`` is the default value, and omitted most of the time. When present, it has no impact on the value, except that it forces the conversion to ``float`` or ``int``, depending on the value. It may also yield a type error, if the conversion is not possible.

``-`` is the explicit value, and the most useful. When present, it turns the value into a ``float`` or ``int``, and multiply it with ``-1``.

PHP tolerate multiple distinct sign tokens: ``+-+-+1`` is the same as ``1``. It is strongly recommended to avoid using it. When an arbitrary number of sign change must be executed, a multiplication by ``-1`` works well.

The signs are distinct from numeric values: ``-9`` is not ``minus nine``, but rather ``-1 * 9``. This is needed to handle expressions such as ``- ( $a * 2)``, where ``-`` applies to the result of the parenthesis. 

It also leads to the unexpected result that ``-3 ** 2 == -9``. In this case, ``**`` power has priority over ``-``, so this is really ``-(3 ** 2) == -9``.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $a = 2;
   $b = -$a; // -2
   
   $c = 123.4;
   $d = +$c; // float(123.4)
   
   // Warning
   
   $e = -3 ** 2; // -9
   
   $f = +-+-+-+-+-4; // -4
   
   ?>
