A diff is the textual difference between two versions of code. It represents the added, removed and modified lines. 

Diffs are a staple of CVS systems. They are important when reviewing a PR, as they represent only the changed lines.

Diffs are used to identify modifications, although they fails a identifying exhaustively all impacts in the code.

Diff is also the name of the software that calculates the difference between two files. 

A diff is not always unique: two files's difference may be represented by two distincts diffs, or more.
