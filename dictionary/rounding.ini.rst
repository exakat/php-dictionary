Rounding
--------

Rouding refers to the process of adjusting numerical values to a certain degree of precision. Most often, it means turning a float number into an integer, although there are roundings in various scales: rounding floats to 2 digits after the decimal separator; rounding to the nearest power of 10; rounding to the next unit, like Mb. 

Rounding has several techniques: that needs to be consistent across applications: rounding to the next integer; to the previous integer; truncating; rounding to the nearest even number; flooring or ceiling; etc.
