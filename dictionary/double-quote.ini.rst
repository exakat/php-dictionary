Double Quotes Strings
---------------------

Double quoted strings are strings that include variables (properties and arrays), which are interpolated at execution time.

This is an extended version of the single-quoted strings. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // single quoted string : all literal values
   $name = 'elephpant loves $signs.';
