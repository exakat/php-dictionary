Facade
------

A facade provides a simplified interface to a complex library. The facade hides the complexity, and iron out some of the dirty details away from the user. 

Facades tends to ease the initial understanding of the library. Later, it limits expert usage and introduce unexpected behavior in the code. 

The Laravel framework is known for its intensive usage of facades.
