Request For Change
------------------

A Request For Change is a document containing a call for an adjustment of a source code.

PHP RFCs are formal proposals for changes or additions to the language. These proposals are used to discuss and decide on new features, syntax modifications, and improvements.

The RFC process allows the PHP community, which includes core developers and the broader user base, to review, comment on, and reach a consensus about proposed changes before they are implemented. This open and collaborative approach helps ensure that significant decisions are made with input from a diverse range of perspectives.

The typical life cycle of an RFC involves several stages, including drafting, discussion, and voting. If an RFC is accepted and receives enough support, the proposed changes are integrated into the PHP source code, and the feature becomes part of a future PHP release
