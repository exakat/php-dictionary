$GLOBALS
--------

$GLOBALS is a global variable, that host all other global variables, during a PHP execution. It is also a super-global, because it is always available, even without import. 

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   global $x;
   $x = 'A';
   
   function counter() {
       echo $GLOBALS['A'];
   }
   
   foo();
   
   ?>
