Suffix
------

A suffix is a word extension, placed after the name. 

In linguistics, suffixes change the meaning of the word, and give it a new built meaning, based on the meanings of the word and the prefix. For example, ``connectabl`` is built with ``connect`` which means connect (sic), and ``able`` which signal that an operation is possible. Connectable, while not an actual Englis word, is the of an application to accept connections.

In PHP, suffixes are used for convention, where classes signals their type with a suffix.

+ ``Controller``: a web controller
+ ``Enum``: an enumeration
+ ``Interface``: an interface, and, sometimes, an abstract class
etc. 

A similar notion is the prefix, which is located at the beginning of the word. Another way to create word is word combinaison.
