Compatibility
-------------

Compatibility refers to the ability of two or more things to work together without conflicts or issues. 

In PHP context, it may refer to 

+ version compatibility, when code works in both versions
+ system compatibility, when code works on different operating systems
+ method compatibility, when methods are compatible in the parent and the child class



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class X {
       function foo(int $i) {}
   }
   
   class Y extends X {
       // The type must be compatible with the one of the parent
       // The name does not have to be the same as in the parent
       function foo(int|null $b) {}
   }
   
   ?>
