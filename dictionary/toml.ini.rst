Tom's Obvious Minimal Language (TOML)
-------------------------------------

TOML stands for Tom’s Obvious, Minimal Language.

It's a configuration file format designed to be human-readable, unambiguous, easy to parse and minimal but expressive.

TOML is considered as a cleaner, stricter alternative to INI, and more readable than JSON for config files.
