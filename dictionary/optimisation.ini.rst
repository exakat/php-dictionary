Optimisation
------------

Optimisation is the act of refactoring code to reduce the amount of resources used during execution. Optimisation may target time (faster execution), memory (using less of), or specific resources (cache that skips recalculating previous results).

Optimisation is called micro-optimisation when the resulting code is both measurably optimized, and in the end, not significant for a specific purpose.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // slow code
   for($i = 0; $i < count($array); ++$i) {
       doSomething($i);
   }
   
   // speed improvement of over 50% of the loop
   $nb = count($array);
   for($i = 0; $i < $nb; ++$i) {
       doSomething($i);
   }
   
   ?>
