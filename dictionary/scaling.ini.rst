Scaling
-------

Scaling refers to the ability of am application to handle increased workload or traffic while maintaining performance, availability, and reliability. When a PHP application needs to scale, it means it needs to accommodate more users, handle more requests, or process more data without sacrificing its responsiveness or stability.

There are several aspects to consider when scaling an application: vertical scaling, horizontal scaling, caching, asynchronous processing, code optimisation, monitoring.
