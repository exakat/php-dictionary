PHP Handlers
------------

PHP handlers are methods which are called to customize the processing of specific events. All those handlers have a default handler, which is used until a new one is configured.

Handlers are usually named by their setting function : 

+ Errors
    + set_error_handler()
    + set_exception_handler()
+ Sessions
    + session_set_save_handler()
    + session_register_shutdown()
+ Execution
    + register_shutdown_function()
+ Ticks
    + register_tick_function()
+ Headers
    + header_register_callback()
+ Streams
    + stream_register_wrapper()
    + stream_wrapper_register()
    + stream_filter_register()
+ Autoload
    + spl_autoload_register()

PHP handlers may be functions, closures and arrow functions.
