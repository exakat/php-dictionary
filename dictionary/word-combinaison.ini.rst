Word Combinaison
----------------

Word combinaison is the technique to build a new word by putting one or several words next to each other, and making the whole a distinct or specialized entity from the individual elements.

Word combinaison is used to build passphrases or names (for methods, properties), by accumulating several notions at the same time.
