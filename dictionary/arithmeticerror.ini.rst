ArithmeticError Error
---------------------

``ArithmeticError`` is thrown when an error occurs while performing mathematical operations. These errors include attempting to perform a bitshift by a negative amount, and any call to intdiv() that would result in a value outside the possible bounds of an int. 

Currently, a bitshift is the main source for arithmetic exceptions. The other is division by zero, which is a child class.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // ArithmeticError is catchable
   try {
       8 >> -1;
   } catch (ArgumentCountError) {
       print 'Cannot do a negative shift';
   }
   ?>
