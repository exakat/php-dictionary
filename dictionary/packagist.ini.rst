Packagist
---------

Packagist is the default package repository for PHP. It's a service that helps PHP developers find and use packages in their projects. A package is a reusable piece of code, typically a library or framework, that can be easily integrated into different projects.

Packagist makes it easy for developers to share their packages with the community. It uses Composer, a dependency manager for PHP, to handle the installation and management of packages. Developers can define the dependencies their projects have in a ``composer.json`` file, and Composer will then fetch and install the required packages from Packagist.
