Microservice
------------

A microservice is a software architectural style that structures an application as a collection of small, independent services, each focused on performing a specific business functionality. These services are designed to work together seamlessly, usually communicating over well-defined APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). Unlike traditional monolithic architectures, where an entire application is built as a single, tightly integrated unit, microservices break down the application into smaller, loosely coupled components.
