Backward Incompatible
---------------------

A feature is backward incompatible when it cannot work with a previous version, and requires a specific version, or more recent.

For example, the function ``str_contains`` is backward incompatible, as it was introduced in PHP 8.0, and is not available in previous versions.

The keyword ``throw`` can be used in expressions such as ``check() or throw new Exception`` since PHP 8.0. In older versions, ``throw`` was available, but needed to be an instruction on its own.

The contrary of a backward incompatible feature is forward compatible.
