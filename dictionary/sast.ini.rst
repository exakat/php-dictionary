Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
------------------------------------------

Static Application Security Testing, or SAST, is a branch of static analysis, dedicated to security. 

It focuses on finding vulnerabilities before the source code hits production. 

For example, SAST searches for injections, XSS, path traversal, insecure deserialization, weak cryptography, missing validation.
