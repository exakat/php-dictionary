Domain Design Driven (DDD)
--------------------------

Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is a software development approach that emphasizes structuring and modeling software based on the real-world domain it is meant to represent. It was popularized by Eric Evans in his book Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software.
