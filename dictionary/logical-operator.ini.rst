Logical operators
-----------------

Logical operators applies four logical functions to booleans. 

+ ``and`` and ``&&``
+ ``or`` and ``||``
+ ``xor`` (no symbolic version for ``xor``)
+ ``!``  (no letter version for ``not``)

The logical operators are either symbolic or letter. Be aware that the symbolic operators have a higher precedence than the letter one, in particular vis-Ã -vis comparisons.

The logical operators work on various types, and output booleans. They are different from the bitwise operators, which work on the value as a bit level, not as a whole.
