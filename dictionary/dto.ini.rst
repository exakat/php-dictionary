Data Transfer Object (DTO)
--------------------------

DTO stands for Data Transfer Object: it is an object that carries data between methods and different part of the architecture. 

DTO is a class, with only properties. It replaces advantageously arrays. It may be used for typing, and do not hold methods.

DTO are easily confused with Value Object: the first one's role is to carry data inside the application, the second one holds data, and can only be compared by its values.
