Short Assignations
------------------

In addition to the basic assignment operator, there are "combined operators" for all of the binary arithmetic, array union and string operators that allow you to use a value in an expression and then set its value to the result of that expression.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // incrementing $a by one
   $a = $a + 1;
   
   // short assignement for the above syntax
   $a += 1;
   
   ?>
