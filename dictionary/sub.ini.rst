Sub (prefix)
------------

``sub`` is a prefix, that is added to existing structure, to express that they are depending on a larger similar structure, which acts as a parent 

It applies to several concepts: 

+ subclasses: classes that extends another class
+ subnamespaces: a namespace that share a prefix with another one

While ``sub-`` is a generic prefix, it is not applied to every possible words, as they are seldom used. It may still produce neologisms, which sound funny, but may become mainstream. For example, a ``sub-interface`` makes sense, but is not used; a sub-trait makes no sense.

   // this is a subnamespace
   namespace A\B { }
   
   ?>
