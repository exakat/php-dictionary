Forward Compatible
------------------

A forward compatible feature is a feature that will be available in future versions. In particular, it might be couple with a forward incompatible feature, which will be dropped, while the forward compatible feature will stay. 

For example, PHP allows the increment of non-numeric strings. This feature might be deprecated, and could be removed in a future version (not defined at the time of writing). The functions ``str_increment()`` and ``str_decrement()`` were introduced in PHP 8.3. They can replace the current feature, and they will be available in the future versions, making them forward compatible. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $a = 't';
   echo ++$a; //u
   
   $a = str_increment($a);
   echo $a; // v
   
   ?>
