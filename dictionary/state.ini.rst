State
-----

In object-oriented PHP, the state of an object refers to the values of its properties at a given time. 

This is an important notion, as PHP is said to be stateless: when used with a web server, every PHP execution is independent from the others, and does not keep state. An object created in one PHP execution is not shared with the other one. Obviously, within the execution of PHP, objects keep their state.
