Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)
---------------------------

"Don't repeat yourself" (DRY) is a principle of software development aimed at reducing repetition of software patterns.

The concept was coined in Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas's book The Pragmatic Programmer, in 1999.

This principle is also known as "Duplication is Evil". Its nemesis is WET : "Write Everything Twice".
