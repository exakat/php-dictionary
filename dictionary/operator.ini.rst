Operators
---------

An operator is something that takes one or more values (or expressions, in programming jargon) and yields another value (so that the construction itself becomes an expression). 

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // not operator, unary
   $a = !$b;
   
   // plus operator
   $c = $d + 2;
   
   // ternary operator
   $e = $d ? 3 : 2;
   
   ?>
