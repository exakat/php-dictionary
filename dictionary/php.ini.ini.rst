.. _php.ini:

php.ini
-------

php.ini is the name of the main configuration file of PHP. It acts as the default configuration. 

php.ini contains directives. For example, ``memory_limit`` or ``default_socket_timeout``.

They may be later redefined using other mechanisms, such as command line options (``-d``), .htaccess or in-code function call (``ini_set()``), although it may vary depending on the directive.
