Pattern Matching
----------------

 Pattern Matching as a language concept contains two parts: Matching a variable against a potentially complex data structure pattern, and optionally extracting values out of that variable into their own variables. In a sense it serves a similar purpose for complex data structures as regular expressions do for strings.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   // This code is extracted from the RFC
   // It is not valid PHP code, as of PHP 8.4. 
   
   // The "is" keyword evaluates to a boolean.
   if ($var is <pattern>) {
     // Do stuff
   }
    
   // Basic type matching
   $var is string;
   $var is int|float;
   $var is ?array;
   $var is (Account&Authenticated)|User;
   $var is mixed; // Matches anything, effectively a wildcard.
    
   // Literal patterns
   $var is "foo";
   $var is 5;
   $var is 3|5|null;
   $var is 'heart'|'spade'|self::Wild;
    
   ?>
