----------------

String increment is the PHP feature that applies the ``++`` pre- and post-increment operators on non-numeric strings. 

These strings last character's ASCII code is incremented by one, with possible extension of the string when the letters reach ``z`` and ``Z``. 

This feature, when based on ``++`` is deprecated, and shall be removed in PHP 9. It has been replaced by the ``str_increment()`` function, which has the same feature, though not implicit in the engine anymore. It is also extended with It has been replaced by the ``str_decrement()``.

A deprecation message is active since PHP 8.3.

   echo ++$s; // z
   echo ++$s; // aa 
   echo ++$s; // ab
   
   $s = 'Y';
   echo ++$s; // Z
   echo ++$s; // AA
   echo ++$s; // AA
   
   ?>
