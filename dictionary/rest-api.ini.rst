REST API
--------

REST stands for Representational state transfer. It formalize an interface to access resources that are physically separated.

REST defines four interface constraints:

+ Identification of resources
+ Manipulation of resources
+ Self-descriptive messages
+ Hypermedia as the engine of application state

REST APIs are documented with OpenAPI (aka, swagger).
