Transpile
---------

Transpiling, short for "source-to-source compiling," is a process in software development where source code written in one programming language is transformed into equivalent code in another programming language. This is typically done to make code compatible with a different runtime environment, platform, or version of a language.

Transpilation is often used in the context of modern web development. For example, many developers write code using newer features of JavaScript, which may not be supported by older web browsers. In such cases, the code can be transpiled to an older version of JavaScript that is more widely supported.
