---------

Increment generally refers to the process of increasing or adding a small amount to a value, or simply by one unit.

In PHP, increments usually refer to the pre-plusplus and post-plusplus.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $a = 1;
   
   ++$a; // pre plus plus 
   
   $a++; // post plus plus 
   
   $a += 1; // increment 
   
   
   ?>
