Support Vector Machine (SVM)
----------------------------

SVM stands for Support Vector Machine. It is the name of a machine learning algorithm which classify data by taking into account n dimensions. 

The algorithm looks for a way to distinguish two sets, by using those nth dimensions. 

PHP supports SVM with the ``ext/svm`` extension and ``rubix/ml`` package.

This acronym is easy to confuse with ``SVN``, which is a source control software.
