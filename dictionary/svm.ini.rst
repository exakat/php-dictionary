Support Vector Machine (SVM)
----------------------------

SVM stands for Support Vector Machine. It is the name of a machine learning algorithm which classify data by taking into account n dimensions. 

The algorithm looks for a way to distinguish two sets, by using those nth dimensions. 

PHP supports SVM with the ext/svm extension and `rubix/ml` package.
