Injection
---------

Injection is the usage of a resource (data, object, services...) that is provided to the method, by the caller.

There are good injections, as the dependency injection.

There are bad injections : all the security ones. SQL injection, PHP code injection, CSV injection, XML injection, etc. Those attempt to change reroute the execution of the method to gain access to unprotected resources.
