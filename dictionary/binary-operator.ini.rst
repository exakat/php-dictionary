Binary Operator
---------------

A binary operator is an operator that operates on a two operands. It performs an operation based on the value of both operand. PHP supports several binary operators, including the following:

+ Assignation operator ``=``
+ Equality operator ``==``
+ Difference operator ``!-`` and ``<>``
+ Identity operator ``===``
+ Non-identity operator ``!==``
+ Math operators, such as addition ``+``, substraction ``-``, multiplication ``*``, division ``/``, power ``**``, modulo ``%``
+ Comparison operators, such as greater than ``>``, greater or equal than ``>=``, lesser than ``<``, lesser or equal than ``<=``
+ Concatenation, with the dot operator ``.``
+ Spaceship operator, ``<=>``
+ All the short operators, that combines a binary operation with an assignation: for example, add and assign ``+=``

And many others.
