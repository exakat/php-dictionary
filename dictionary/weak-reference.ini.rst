Weak References
---------------

Weak references allow the programmer to retain a reference to an object which does not prevent the object from being destroyed. They are useful for implementing cache like structures. 

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $obj = new stdClass;
   $weakref = WeakReference::create($obj);
   
   var_dump($weakref->get());
   unset($obj);
   
   var_dump($weakref->get());
   // NULL
   
   ?>
