Shell
-----

A shell is a program that provides an interface for users to interact with the operating system (OS) and execute commands. It acts as a command interpreter, taking input from the user, interpreting it, and then executing the appropriate actions.

PHP is able to relay commands to the OS using dedicated local functions, such as ``shell_exec()``, ``exec()````system()``, ``passthru()`` and the back-tick operator. It is also able to access remote shells with the ``ssh://`` protocol.

Shells provide a important access to the underlying OS: they are considered as a critical point of entry for security attacks. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $output = shell_exec('ls -lart');
   echo <pre>$output</pre>;
   
   ?>
