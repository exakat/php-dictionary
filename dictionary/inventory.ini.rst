Code Inventory
--------------

A code inventory is the collection of all elements of the same type, for categorized review. 

For example, variable names, error messages, namespaces, regexes are all interesting inventories. 

Inventories work best when the code practice is scattered: exceptions and regexes are usually created where and when needed, and are rarely considered as a common asset. That leads to repetition and deformations.
