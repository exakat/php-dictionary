Non-static
----------

Non-static is the opposite of static, when used with methods, closures, properties or variables. 

There is no other term to designate them, beside the convention that a variable is non-static, by default.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $variable = 1;
   
   static $staticVariable = 2;
   
   ?>
