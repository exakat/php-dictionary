Recursion
---------

Recursion in PHP is a method or a function, which calls itself. 

While the method calls itself, it also must have branch and not call itself : otherwise, the call will never end.

Functions, methods, closures and arrowfunctions may be recursive.

Recursion is an abstract notion : it is also used in the PHP name itself. PHP : Hypertext Preprocessor.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   function factorial(int $number) { 
       if ($number < 2) { 
           return 1; 
       }
   
       return ($number * factorial($number - 1)); 
   }
   
   // recursive closure
   $factorial = function( $n ) use ( &$factorial ) {
       if( $n == 1 ) return 1;
       return $factorial( $n - 1 ) * $n;
   };
   
   ?>
