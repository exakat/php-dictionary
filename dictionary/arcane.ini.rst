Arcane
------

Arcane refers to weird features, that are almost unknown or forgotten. They have been with the language since the early versions, and they are eventually removed.

+ It is possible to use ``++`` on a string containing variables. In that case, trailing letters are augmented by one. 
+ strpos() used to accept an integer as second argument: it would convert it automatically to its ASCII equivalent.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $a = 'b';
   echo ++$a; // c
   
   // 98 is b
   print strpos('abc', 99); // 1
   // This was removed in PHP 8.0
   
   ?>
