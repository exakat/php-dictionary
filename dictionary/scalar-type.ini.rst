Scalar Types
------------

Scalar types refer to the basic data types that hold a single value. 

PHP scalar types include the following:

Integer (``int``): integers are whole numbers without decimal points. 

Float (``float``): floats, also known as floating-point numbers or doubles, represent decimal numbers. 

String  (``string``): strings are sequences of characters enclosed in quotes (single or double).

Boolean  (``bool``): booleans have two possible values: true or false. 

Note that ``null`` is not considered a scalar type, and is often behaving differently. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   function gen_one_to_three() {
       for ($i = 1; $i <= 3; $i++) {
           // Note that $i is preserved between yields.
           yield $i;
       }
   }
   
   ?>
