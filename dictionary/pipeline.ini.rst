Pipeline
--------

A pipeline is a chain of steps that composes a sequential set of actions.

A pipeline is used with : 

+ datasets, to read, transform and save data
+ continuous integration, where each check and packaging follows the previous one
+ processing, where each step is a separate process

The pipeline image is related to the assembly line, from factories.
