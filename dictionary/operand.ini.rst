Operand
-------

An operand is an argument for an operator. It applies to any of the operand: to differentiate them later, they are named with their position (first, second, etc.), or their name.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // One operand
   $b = !$a;
   
   // two operands
   $a = 1 + 3;
   
   // Three operands
   $c = $a ? 2 : 4;
   
   ?>
