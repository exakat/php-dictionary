Imperative Programming
----------------------

Declarative programming is the programming style where each step is described to the programm, which then, executes them one after the other.

This approach favors the control on the execution: it is easy to check the steps, and enforce that each step is done when expected. 

Imperative programming does not leave room for optimisation, as the step orders is controlled externally. Everything has to be written as expected, leading to extra labor.
