Strict Comparison
-----------------

Strict comparison is a comparison operator or a control structure that checks not only the value but also the type of the value. In other words, it does not apply any type-juggling to the values before processing. 

Here are the strict operators : ``==`` may be replaced with ``===``,  ``!=`` may be replaced with ``!==``, ``switch`` may be replaced with ``match``, in_array() with the third parameter ``strict`` set to true. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   //true
   var_dump(1 == "1");
   //false
   var_dump(1 === "1");
   
   //true
   var_dump(null == 0);
   //false
   var_dump(null === 0);
   
   ?>
