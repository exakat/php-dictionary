Multi-byte
----------

Multi-byte refers to string encoding where characters are coded over several bytes, rather than just one. 

In ASCII, the roman alphabet is coded over 1 character, making it mono-byte. But other languages, such as Chinese, needs for than one byte to represents all the ideograms. 

Unicode, for example, is multi-byte: 2 bytes. It may be encoded as UTF-8 (2 bytes), UTF-16 (4 bytes) or UTF-32 (8 bytes).

In PHP, string functions are single-byte. When needed, extensions such as ``iconv``, ``intl`` and ``mbstring`` are able to manipulate multi-byte characters without breaking them.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   print strlen(me); // 2 chars
   
   print strlen(我); // 3 chars
   
   print mb_strlen(我); // 1 chars
   
   ?>
