Socket
------

A socket refers to a communication endpoint that allows two processes on a network to exchange data. Sockets provide a mechanism for processes on different devices to communicate with each other, whether they are on the same machine or across the Internet.

PHP provides a set of functions for working with sockets, allowing developers to create both client and server applications that can communicate over networks using various protocols, including TCP and UDP.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $server = socket_create(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, SOL_TCP);
   socket_bind($server, '127.0.0.1', 8080);
   socket_listen($server);
   $client = socket_accept($server);
   
   ?>
