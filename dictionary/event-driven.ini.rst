Event Driven
------------

Event-driven programming is a programming paradigm that focuses on the flow of a program's execution being determined by events or actions that occur, rather than following a strictly sequential, procedural path. In event-driven programming, the program responds to events generated by external factors, such as user interactions, sensor inputs, or messages from other software components. Events can trigger specific functions or pieces of code to execute in response.
