Static Constant
---------------

Static constants are constants that are defined inside a class, interface, trait (since PHP 8.2) and enumeration. 

Static constants have a visibility. Visibility may be ``public``, ``protected``, ``private``. By default, and for backward compatibility, a constant without a visibility is ``public``.

Static constants may also be overwritten by children classes. They can also use the ``final`` keyword, to avoid such behavior.

Static constants are defined at coding time, and cannot be changed later, not dynamically created. 

Static constant syntax is the same than for enumeration cases.

       private const BAR = 2;

   ?>
