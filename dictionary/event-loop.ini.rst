Event Loop
----------

An event loop is a mechanism for handling asynchronous operations and event-driven programming. While PHP traditionally follows a synchronous execution model where each operation blocks the execution until it completes, the introduction of event loops enables non-blocking I/O operations and improves concurrency.

PHP event loops are often implemented using extensions like ReactPHP or Amp.
