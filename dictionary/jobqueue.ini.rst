Jobqueue
--------

A job queue is a concept that refers to a system or data structure used to manage and schedule the execution of various tasks or jobs in a sequential or parallel manner. 

Job queues are commonly used in scenarios where there is a need to process multiple tasks asynchronously, ensuring that tasks are executed efficiently and in an organized manner.

A job queue may organize the tasks in different way : by priority, by type, by sequence, by estimated load, by available worker, etc.
