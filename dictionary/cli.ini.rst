Command Line Interface (CLI)
----------------------------

PHP provides support for a Command Line Interface (CLI) mode, which allows developers to execute PHP scripts directly from the terminal or command prompt without needing a web server. In this mode, commands are passed as a file or lines of text, and the PHP interpreter processes them sequentially. This feature is particularly useful for automation tasks, cron jobs, scripting, testing, or running PHP-based tools. Additionally, the CLI mode offers access to command-line arguments, making it possible to write interactive scripts or utilities that can process user input or parameters at runtime.
