Design Pattern Wrapper
----------------------

A wrapper is also a design pattern, also called an adaptor. This concept also appears when a component provide access to a remote service : it is a PHP wrapper (wrapper for the service when calling PHP) or a `service-name` wrapper, when it is viewed from PHP.
