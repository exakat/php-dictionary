max_execution_time
------------------

The ``max_execution_time`` directive sets the maximum amount of time that PHP will work on an application. 

The default value is 30 seconds. It may be lowered down to 1 second, or set to infinity with -1.

``max_execution_time`` may be changed from the code with set_time_limit(). This function may also be disabled, and not available.

It is recommended to set this value as low as possible, and optimize the code to run below that limit.
