Content Management System (CMS)
-------------------------------

A CMS stands for Content Management System. It's software that creates, edits, organizes, and publishes content on a website without needing to write code.

PHP has a lot of CMS. Here is a list: 

``WordPress <https://wordpress.org/>``_
``Drupal <https://www.drupal.org/>``_
``Joomla <https://www.joomla.org/>``_
``TYPO3 <https://typo3.org/>``_
``ProcessWire <https://processwire.com/>``_
``Bolt CMS <https://boltcms.io/>``_
``Textpattern <https://textpattern.com/>``_
``Geeklog <http://www.geeklog.net/>``_

A CMS is a more specialized version of a framework: it deals with online content. 

CMS may be open source or proprietary. They usually come with a marketplace, which publishes third-party plugins, extensions or components.
