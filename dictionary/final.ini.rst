Final Keyword
-------------

The final keyword prevents child classes from overriding a method or a constant by prefixing the definition with final.

The final keyword cannot be used with the private keyword : a private method is not visible in the child classes, and can't also be redefined.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class x {
       final const X = 1;
       
       final function method() { }
   }
   
   ?>
