UTF-8
-----

UTF-8 is a character encoding standard. It is defined by the Unicode Standard. The acronym stands for ``Unicode Transformation Format â€“ 8-bit``. 

PHP handles the UTF-8 encoding natively: at input time, with the ``input_encoding`` directive; at output time, with the ``output_encoding`` and internally with the ``internal_encoding``. All of them can use independant values, yet they all default to ``default_charset``, which uses ``UTF-8`` as default value.

For other manipulations, such as converting sources such as file or databases content to and from UTF-8, PHP relies on ``mbstring`` and ``iconv`` libraries.

Special functions, such as ``utf8_encode`` and ``utf8_decode()`` are deprecated since PHP 8.2, and should be be used.
