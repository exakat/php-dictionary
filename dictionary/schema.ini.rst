Schema
------

A schema is a blueprint or structural representation of the organization and structure of a database. It defines how data is organized and how relationships between data are handled within the database system. In essence, a database schema specifies the logical design of the database, including the tables, fields, relationships, constraints, and other characteristics that define the data storage and retrieval.
