Abstraction
-----------

An abstraction, or also an abstraction layer, is a way to hide the underlying complexity of some logic behind a simpler interface so that other parts of the program don’t need to worry about the details.

In that sense, it is related to the ``abstract`` keyword, which introduces a signature and leaves freedom of implementation.
