.. _object-api:

Object API
----------

The Object API is a set of classes, interfaces, enums and traits to execute features. 

The alternative is the function API, which is a set of functions to execute features. 

Some PHP extensions have a dual object and function API, for example mysqli. 

PHP packages have rarely a dual API.
