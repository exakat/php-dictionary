Form
----

A form is a web page component to collect and submit information. 

The form submits the information using HTTP protocol, and the GET or POST method. It is generally processed by the browser.

The form defines variable, whose content is submitted to the PHP script. Those values are accessed with $_GET, $_POST, $_REQUEST.

Form is an HTML element, in a web page. As such, it may be created by PHP, when PHP produces HTML documents.
