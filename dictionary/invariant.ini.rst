Type Invariant
--------------

A type invariant is a data container whose type can't change between a parent class and a child class. This is the case of properties.

The child type must be a subtype of the parent type and the parent type must be a subtype of the child type. This implies that the types are equal.

Invariance is the third type of variance, with contravariance and covariance.

   <?php
   
   class p {
   	protected string $p;
   }
   
   class q extends p {
   	// same a above
   	protected string $p;
   }
   
   ?>
