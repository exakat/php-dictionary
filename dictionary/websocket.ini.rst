Websocket
---------

WebSockets are a communication protocol that enables full-duplex, real-time communication between a client (e.g., a web browser) and a server over a single, persistent TCP connection. Unlike traditional HTTP requests, which are stateless and require a new connection for each request/response cycle, WebSockets keep the connection open, allowing both the client and server to send and receive data anytime without needing to re-establish a connection.

PHP does not have built-in WebSocket support, but you can use libraries like Ratchet or write a custom WebSocket server using PHPâ€™s socket functions.
