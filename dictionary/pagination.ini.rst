Pagination
----------

Pagination is a technique used in web development to break down and display a large set of data or content into smaller, more manageable chunks called pages. This is especially useful when dealing with long lists, tables, or search results, as it enhances user experience and reduces the amount of data loaded at once. Pagination is commonly seen in search engine results, product listings, blog archives, and other scenarios where content needs to be organized across multiple pages.
