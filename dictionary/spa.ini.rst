Single Page Application (SPA)
-----------------------------

SPA's a web application or website that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current page, rather than loading entire new pages from the server. This approach provides a smoother and more fluid user experience, as the page doesn't need to be fully reloaded for every interaction. SPAs often use JavaScript frameworks like htmx, React, Angular, or Vue.js to handle these dynamic updates and manage the application state.
