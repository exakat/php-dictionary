An anonymous structure is a structure that usually has a name, but may also go without it. 

There a several structures which may have an anonymous version : 

+ functions : there are two types : closures and arrow functions
+ method : the magic method __invoke()
+ classes
+ constants : basically, it is a literal value
+ catch : in this case, the exception is caught, but it is not provided in a related variable

Some structures are always named: variables, properties, traits, interfaces, enums.

Anonymous structures should not be confused with dynamic structures: these structures are defined with a name which is stored in a variable, or a similar data container. In fact, dynamic structures often rely on a name to be useable. This is the case of variables, with ``$$variable``.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   	$closure = function () {} ; 
   
   	$arrowFunction = fn() => 1;
   	
   	'literal value';
   	
   	// an object of an anonymous class
   	new class() {}; 
   	
   	try {}
   	catch(Exception ) {}
   	
   ?>
