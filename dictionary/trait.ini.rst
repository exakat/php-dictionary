Trait
-----

Traits are a mechanism for code reuse in single inheritance languages.

Traits define methods and properties. They are included in one or several classes by the use of ``use`` expression.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   trait t {
       const CONSTANT = 1;
       
       private $property;
   
       function method();
   }
   
   class x { 
       use t;
   }
   
   ?>
