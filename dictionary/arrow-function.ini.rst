Arrow Functions
---------------

Arrow functions are a type of closure with a specific syntax. It only accepts one expression, and automatically imports all the variables from the local context of definition. 

Arrow functions may also be marked as ``static``, to prevent this import.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $b = 10;
   $fn = fn($a) => $a + $b + 2;
   
   ?>
