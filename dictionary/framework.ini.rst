Framework
---------

A framework is a library of code and practices that helps building PHP applications. Frameworks provide common features, such as forms, authentications, templating, arguments and security. 

Frameworks are often described as a platform : they stand as a layer above PHP, with its own conventions and behaviors. PHP is the language of the framework, and the language used to extends the framework.

There are lots of frameworks in PHP. In alphabetical order:
