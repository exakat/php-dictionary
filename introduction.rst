Introduction
++++++++++++

PHP dictionary is a complement to the PHP manual. 

Do you know what is the 'dangling reference' problem? Or the Last Static binding? or the 'garbage collection' ? 

The PHP dictionary provides a list of words, concepts, keywords and expressions used commonly in the PHP ecosystem,
with a short definition and extra links to more resources. 

The goal is to provide a place that gathers an entrypoint for each PHP notion, and help anyone reading an article understand it.
