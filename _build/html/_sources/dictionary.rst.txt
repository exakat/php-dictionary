.. _$_files:

$_FILES
-------

An associative array of items uploaded to the current script via the HTTP POST method.

+ ``$_FILES['userfile']['name']`` : the original name of the file on the client machine.
+ ``$_FILES['userfile']['type']`` : the mime type of the file, if the browser provided this information. An example would be image/gif. This mime type is however not checked on the PHP side and therefore don't take its value for granted.
+ ``$_FILES['userfile']['size']`` : the size, in bytes, of the uploaded file.
+ ``$_FILES['userfile']['tmp_name']`` : the temporary filename of the file in which the uploaded file was stored on the server.
+ ``$_FILES['userfile']['error']`` : the error code associated with this file upload.
+ ``$_FILES['userfile']['full_path']`` : the full path as submitted by the browser. This value does not always contain a real directory structure, and cannot be trusted. Available as of PHP 8.1.0.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
       // $a->file was filled with $_FILES at some point
       move_uploaded_file($a->file['tmp_name'], $target);
   
   ?>

.. _$_get:

$_GET
-----

An associative array of variables, transmitted to the current script via the HTTP GET method, in the URL.

The received values are all strings or arrays. They are strings by default, and other scalar types needs a casting. The values are arrays when the URL uses the `[]` format. 

$_GET is a superglobal : it is always available, in every scope.

Values inside $_GET are always strings, or arrays. `https://www.site.com/index.php?x=1` or `https://www.site.com/index.php?x[2]=1`.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // https://www.example.com/index.php?x=1
   $_GET['x'] === '1';
   
   // https://www.example.com/index.php?y=abc
   $_GET['y'] === 'abc';
   
   // https://www.example.com/index.php?z[]=def&z[]=ghi
   $_GET['z'] === array('def', 'ghi');
   
   ?>

.. _$_post:

$_POST
------

An associative array of variables, transmitted to the current script via the HTTP POST method, with the MIME types `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` or `multipart/form-data`.

The received values are all strings or arrays. They are strings by default, and other scalar types needs a casting. The values are arrays when the URL uses the `[]` format. 

$_POST is a superglobal : it is always available, in every scope.

Values inside $_POST are always strings, or arrays.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // POST x=1
   $_POST['x'] === '1';
   
   // POST y=abc
   $_POST['y'] === 'abc';
   
   // POST z[]=def
   // POST z[]=ghi
   $_POST['z'] === array('def', 'ghi');

.. _$_request:

$_REQUEST
---------

An associative array of variables, transmitted to the current script via the HTTP GET and HTTP methods.

When the same name is used both in GET and POST method, the priority is defined by the `variable_order` directive. 

The received values are all strings or arrays. They are strings by default, and other scalar types needs a casting. The values are arrays when the URL uses the `[]` format. 

$_REQUEST is a superglobal : it is always available, in every scope.


.. code-block:: php

That way, it is possible to create dynamically methods, without hardcoding them. 

The __call() method receives the name of the target-method, and a list of argument. 

The __call() method has a related version for static methods, called `__callStatic`.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class x {

.. _-__clone:

__clone
-------

To clone an object is the creation of a new distinct object, from an existing one. This is basically a copy, although the object itself is multiplied by call the clone operator.

By default PHP does a shallow clone, duplicating the scalars (string, integer...) and keeping the same reference to objects. To make a deep clone, the class must define the ``__clone`` magic method.

Cloning is similar to creating another object of the same class, without requiring all the constructor arguments.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $spike = new Dog('Spike', 'Teckel', 'red');
   $medor = clone $spike;

.. _-__set_state:

__set_state() method
--------------------

__set_state() is a magic method : it is called when an object has been exported with var_export(), and has to be instantiated again. 

__set_state() is tasked with recreating the object, assigning the previous values to it, and recreating any missing properties, such as database connexions or resources.

The __set_state() method has no counterpart : var_export() do not use any magic method. 

__set_state() is a static method, unlike the other magic methods.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class x {
   	private $values = ['a' => 1,

.. _-__tostring:

__toString() method
-------------------

__tostring() is a magic method : it is called when the object has to be turned into a string.

That way, it is possible to dynamically convert the object to a string and display it, or transmit it to another part of the application. 

__toString() is called when strict_type is not active. Otherwise, passing an object to a string parameter yields an error.

__toString() is always called in concatenation, string interpolation,

.. _a11y:

Accessibility
-------------

Accessibility is the process to make the code accessible to everyone. 

PHP code being text, its accessibility relies on the IDE. The main accessible feature is the usage of tabulations, instead of multiple spaces.

Accessibility is also called `a11y`, aka a, 11 letters and y. This is shorter to write.

.. _anonymous-class:

Anonymous Class
---------------

A class may be instantiated, without defining a class name. The class is identical to a named-class, except for the name attribute. This also means that it cannot be used for typehinting, though it may be typed itself, using parent class or implemented interfaces. 

Also, arguments may be passed at instantiation time, unlike with named-class definition, where those arguments are passed when calling ``new``, not when defining the class.


.. code-block:: php

.. _arbitrary-argument:

Arbitrary Number of Argument
----------------------------

PHP allows any number of arguments to be passed to a functioncall. In the function definition, receiving those arguments means managing an arbitrary number of parameters. 

This is achieved with the variadic operator, or with functions such as func_get_args().

They are also called variable argument lists.

When the arguments are dynamic, aka they are collected at execution time, the operator variadic or the function call_user_func_array() turns an array to arguments.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   function foo(...$args) {
       print This function is called with.count($args).arguments\n;
       print This function is called with.func_get_count().arguments\n;
       print This function is called with.count($func_get_args()).arguments\n;
   } 
   
   $array = range(0, rand(5, 10)); // generates an array with 1 to 11 elements
   
   foo(...$array);
   call_user_func_array('foo', $array));
   
   ?>

Archive
-------

Archives are a single document that stores a collection of files and directories. 

There are the PHAR : PHP Archives, which contains PHP code, and any other kind of file, and may be used to execute. 

There are also other archive formats, such as TAR (for files) or JAR (for Java applications), etc.

.. _argument:

Argument
--------

Arguments are values passed to a function or method, at execution time. They may be a variable or an expression.

.. _argumentcounterror:

ArgumentCountError
------------------

ArgumentCountError is thrown when too few arguments are passed to a user-defined function or method. This is an error, not an exception.

No exception is raised for extra parameters, as those may still be processed by the method itself. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   function foo($a) {}
   
   // No error is raised here
   foo(1,2);
   
   // ArgumentCountError is catchable

ArithmeticError Error
---------------------

``ArithmeticError`` is thrown when an error occurs while performing mathematical operations. These errors include attempting to perform a bitshift by a negative amount, and any call to intdiv() that would result in a value outside the possible bounds of an int. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // ArithmeticError is catchable
   try {
       8 >> -1;

.. _array:

Array
-----

array is the array structure in PHP. 

It may be written as array() or with square brackets `[]`.

An array assigns automatically an integer index to the values appended to it. An arbitrary index may be assigned with the => syntax, or when accessing an element in the array. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $array = array(1, 2, 3); 
   
   $anotherArray = ['a' => 2, 'b' => 33];

.. _append:
.. _array-append:
.. _push:

Array Append
------------

Append is an array operation, which adds an element at the end of the array. It is also called a push.

There are two operators for this feature ; the ``[]`` operator, which has to be placed after a variable or member. There is also the array_push() function, which is available as a callback, unlike the operator.

The opposite operation is a pop, with the function array_pop(). Array_unshift() is the append at the beginning of the array. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $array = [1, 2, 3];
   $array[] = 4;
   
   $array []= 5; // Same as above, with a notation similar to a short assignation
   
   array_push($array, 6);
   
   // $array === [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
   ?>

.. _array-spread:

Array spread
------------

Array spread is the ellipsis operator, applied to an array. Then, the array itself is replaced by each of its own element, as if each element was spread from the array.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $a = [1,2,3];
   $b = [...$a, 4,5];
   
   // $b === [1,2,3,4,5];

.. _assertion:
.. _assert:

Assertions
----------

Assertions are checks that take effect in development and testing environments, but are optimised away to have zero cost in production. 

Assertions are disabled in production, by using the `zend.assertions` directive. Then, they are said 'zero-cost' : they are completely removed from the code, and not executed.

Assertions are a development tool, and should not be used in production. Be aware that the removal of the assertion may leave the system running with unchecked data. 

There are packages providing assertions features and more.




.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $a = foo();
   assert($a !== null, 'Sorry, we got a NULL from foo()!');

Assignations
------------

The basic assignment operator is `=`. Your first inclination might be to think of this as `equal to`. Don't. It really means that the left operand gets set to the value of the expression on the right (that is, "gets set to").

Assumption
----------

An assumption is a piece of code that makes use of knowledge that is not visible in the script. 

Assumptions are often related to arrays : after checking that a variable is of type array, some specific index are used, while there is not guarantee that they are available.

Assumptions may be upgraded to assertions. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
   
   function foo($o) {
   	if ($o instanceof A) {
   		print $o->getName();
   	} else {
   		// if $o is not an object of type A, then it is an array. Where does this come from?

.. _block:

Block
-----

Blocks are none, one or more instructions, grouped together with or without curly brackets.

Blocks may require brackets, like for classes, switch(), function bodies; they might be optional, like with cases, arrow-functions or loops.

Boolean
-------

A boolean is a value that is either true or false. 

PHP's boolean are constants. They may be prefixed by ``\\``, and are case-insensitive. They can't be redefined in namespaces.

There are rules to convert any data to a boolean. 

Booleans have a related scalar typehint : ``bool``. There is also a special ``false`` typehint.

Break
-----

Break is a control structure, which ends execution of the current for, foreach, while, do-while or switch structure.

break accepts an optional argument, which tells how many enclosing structures are to be broken out of. 

break should not be confused with `continue` : continue doesn't work in a switch, like a break does.

   foreach([1,2,3] as $b) {
       // break upon the first even number
       if ($b % 2 == 0) {

.. _callback:

Callback
--------

Callback are functions which are used as parameters for other functions. Such functions are used to customize the main function. For example, array_map(), which applies a callback to every element of an array, or usort(), which sorts an array using a function.

Callback is akin to a functioncall : it is actually hidden inside the caller function. 

Callback may be build with on closures, arrow-functions, native PHP functions, methods and static methods. They also use string (i.e., `'strtolower'`) and array (i.e. `[X::class, 'methodName']`, or `[$object, 'methodName']` ) syntax. In fact, anything that is_callable() may be used. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $array = ['Damien', 'Dan', 'Daniel', 'Davey', 'David', 'Dennis', 'Derick', 'Dmitry', 'Dustin',];
   $array = array_map('strtolower', $array);

Cast operator
-------------

Cast operators change the type of the variable to the desired type. Conversion between the current format and the target format may happen. 

The casts allowed are:

(int), (integer) - cast to integer
(bool), (boolean) - cast to boolean
(float), (double), (real) - cast to float
(string) - cast to string
(array) - cast to array
(object) - cast to object
(unset) - cast to NULL (Deprecated since PHP 7.2)

.. _catch:

Catch
-----

Catch is the complement clause of try : it defines which exception is caught. Optionaly, it defines which variable holds the exception when it happens (since PHP 8.0).

Multiple catches may be used. They are applied in the order of coding, and the first clause which succeed is the last.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   try {
       callSomeMethod();
   } catch (\SomeException $e) {
       display(Warning);

.. _exception-chain:

Chaining Exceptions
-------------------

Chaining exception is throwing again a caught exception, with a new type, and with the previous exception. 

To provide the previous exception to a new exception, use the third parameter of the Exception constructor. Also, always provide a third argument to custom exceptions.

The previous exception is available with the `getPrevious()` method of the Exception class.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class myException extends \Exception {
   	function __construct(string $message, $code, \Throwable $exception) {
   		parent::__construct($message, $code, $exception);
   	}
   }
   
   try {
   	doSomething();
   } catch(\Exception $e) {
   	// chaining exception
   	throw new myException('doSomething failed', 0, $e);
   }

.. _class-alias:

Class aliases
-------------

It is possible to make an alias of a class and call it with this new name. It either rely on the `use` expression, preferable at the beginning of the namespace, or the class_alias() function, for dynamic and application-wide aliases. 

`use` expressions are valid only in one file, while class_alias() impacts the whole application, once it is called. class_alias() may also be used with dynamic elements, such as variabless.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   use a as b;

.. _autoload:

Class Autoloading
-----------------

Autoloading provides a hook to allow the loading of a class, the first PHP requires it. This is a more flexible way to handle the class definitions than the traditional inclusions, which requires good planning.

Autoloading requires each class, trait, interface or enumeration to be stored in a distinct file. This is the most popular way, yet autoloading allows any other strategy of storage, as long as the class may be loaded based only on its name.

Autoloading relies on the spl_autoload_register() function. Prior to PHP 8.0, it was possible to define the  __autoload() method, and this has being deprecated since PHP 7.2.

Autoloading does not work for global constants and functions. Those still require a specific inclusion mechanism.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   spl_autoload_register(function ($class_name) {
       include $class_name . '.php';
   });
   
   $obj  = new MyClass1();
   $obj2 = new MyClass2(); 
   ?>

.. _class-constant:

Class constant
--------------

It is possible to define constants on a per-class basis remaining the same and unchangeable. The default visibility of class constants is public.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class x {
       public  const FOO = 1;

Class Getter Method
-------------------

Getters are methods used to access the values of a property. Getters may include some formatting. 

Getters are usually created with a setter method.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class x {
       private $property;
       
       public function getProperty() {

.. _class-hoisting:

Class Hoisting
--------------

Class hoisting is a compilation mode where the declaration of functions, classes... are moved before their actual usage.

This allows the usage of functions that are declared later in the code. 

PHP doesn't do class hoisting : it does two passes on the code, and later, triggers the autoload if a class is missing. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
   
   // displays foo
   foo();
   
   function foo() { echo __FUNCTION__; }
   
   ?>

.. _class-invasion:

Class Invasion
--------------

Objects of the same type will have access to each others private and protected members even though they are not the same instances. 

Class invasion doesn't work when running an external closure inside the class.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class X {
       private $p = abc;
   
       function foo(X $x) {
           echo $x->p;
       }
       
       function set($s) {
           $this->p = $s;
       }
   }
   
   $x1 = new x;
   $x1->set('xyz');
   
   $x2 = nex x;
   $x2->foo($x1);
   // display xyz

.. _class-operator:

Class Operator
--------------

Class operator is the `::class`, added to a class, interface, trait or enumeration identifier. It returns the fully qualified name of the class, according to the current code. 

`::class` is affected by `use` expressions, but not by class_alias(); function. 

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // class operator in action
   // This is an unknown class, so it displays A\B
   echo A\B::class;
   
   // This is an 'use' class, so it displays A\B
   use A\B as D;
   echo D::class;
   
   // class_alias creates a new class, so it is different. 
   class E{}
   class_alias('E', 'F');
   echo F::class;

.. _setter:

Class Setter Method
-------------------

Setters are methods used to give the values of a property. Setters may apply some filtering and validation before accepting the value.

Setters are usually created with a getter method.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class x {
       private $property;
       
       public function setProperty($value) {

.. _clone:

Clone
-----

Clone makes a duplicate of an object.

PHP makes a shallow clone : it will only make a copy of the scalars properties, and it will keep the reference to any object untouched. This means that objects are shared between an object and its clone. 

To perform a deep clone, aka to clone an object and its referenced properties, there is the magic method __clone().



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class x { }
   
   // instantiation
   $x = new x;
   
   // cloning
   $y = clone $x;

Closure
-------

Closures are anonymous functions : functions without a name. They are also supported by the eponymous `Closure` class in PHP.

They are close to the arrow-functions. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $closure = function ($a) use ($b) {
       return $a + $b + 1;

.. _closure-binding:

Closure Binding
---------------

A closure acquires values from its context of creation. When the closure is created in a different context that wished, one may rebind the closure to another context.

This is done with the two methods Closure::bind() and Closure::bintTo();


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   class A {
       private static function foo() { return 1;}
   }
   
   $closure = function() {
       // Self is undefined here, since it is not inside a class
       return self::foo();
   };
   
   // Self now defined, and set to A
   $bcl1 = Closure::bind($closure, null, 'A');

   class x { }
   
   // instantiation
   $x = new x;

.. _code-injection:

Code Injection
--------------

A CODE injection is a vulnerability, where external data is used as PHP code.  

In the example below, `$_GET` is directly used in the eval() function. By using a clever string (shown in comment), it is possible to assign the variable, and run the phpinfo() command. 

Among the solutions to mitigate this problem : filter adequately the incoming data; use prepared statements. 

Some PHP functions are sensitive to this kind of attack : eval(), include(), include_once(), require(), require_once(). Dynamic calls are also suceptible of code injection. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
   
   // $_GET['x'] = '1; phpinfo()';
   eval("$myvar = $x;");
   
   // $_GET['method'] = 'getSafe';
   // Any method may be called on the safe object
   $data->$method();
   
   ?>

.. _compact-array:

Compact array
-------------

An array is compact if it only uses automated indices, starting with 0. This doesn't really show in PHP code, though performances are better for some operations.

Such array's status may be reached by using array_values() or array_keys() on the array. 

This notion is not related to the compact() function.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $array = [1,2,3];
   
   $notCompact = [1,2,3, 4=>4];

.. _compact:

compact()
---------

compact() is a native PHP function, which creates an array containing variables and their values.

It is the opposite of extract().

   <?php
   
   $a = '1';
   $b = '2';
   
   $array = compact('a', 'b');

Comparison
----------

Comparison operators, as their name implies, allow you to compare two values. 

PHP comparisons exists wiht type-juggling, `==`, `<>`, `<=>`, switch() and `!=`, and with type checks, match(), `===` and `!==`. 

Inegalities only exists with type-juggling. 

There are also functions dedicated to comparisons, with specific applications : strcmp(), strcasecmp(), strnatcasecpm(), strcoll(), similar_text(), levensthein(), bccomp(), version_compare(), hash_equals().

.. _compression:

Compression
-----------

Compression is the representation of data in a format that uses less space that the original raw data. 

A compression algorithm must provide a way to compress data, and a way to uncompress it, and give access to the original data.

There are lossless compression, which can provide the exact original data (for text, ...) and lossy compression which degrades the original data (for images, video, ...).

PHP supports compression via zip, rar, zlib, bzip2.

Concatenation
-------------

Concatenation is the PHP feature that appends two strings together, to make a third, longer one.

Concatenation is also achieved with interpolation, inside a string; by calling echo, multiple times or with multiple arguments; by using the join() function.

Concatenation is done with the dot operator. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   $a = world;
   $b = Hello;
   echo $b.$a;
   // displays Hello world

.. _conditioned:

Conditioned Structures
----------------------

Conditioned structures are definitions that are placed inside a condition structure. 

For example, it is possible to create a function or a class, only if it doesn't exist. 

classes, traits, interfaces, global constants (with define()), enumerations, functions may be conditioned. 

class constants, properties, methods and cases (for ``enum``) cannot be conditioned.

Conditioned structures adapt the PHP context to external condition. For example, some function may become native after a specific PHP version, and is only redefined for older installation. 

Some structures do not accept condition, such as global constants with `const` keyword (with define() function, it is OK).



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   if (!function_exists('foo')) {
       function foo() {

Configuration
-------------

Configuration is a set of data that conditions the execution of the program.

Generally, configuration isn' changed during the execution of the program. 

PHP has three location for configuration : php.ini, .htaccess and usage of the ini_set() functions. 

Each item of configuration is called a directive.

Const
-----

const is a PHP keyword, that introduces constant definitions. 

const is allowed inside classes and traits, to create class constants. const is also allowed in the global scope, to create global constants. 

const is only allowed in the body of a trait and a class, and the first level of a main file. It is not possible to create conditioned constants with a if-then structure and const : this requires an include.

A cryptographic hash is an algorithm which maps a string to a fixed sized string, with a method that is difficult to revert.

Some famous algorithm : MD5, SHA1, SHA256, HAVAL, Bcrypt.

Other algorithms include crc32(), though it is not considered a cryptography. 

While the extension 'hash' only process hashes, there are other extensions which offer these features : openssl, sodium and password hashing. Mhash and mcrypt are older PHP extensions, which are now discontinued.

.. _csv-injection:

CSV injection
-------------

A CSV injection is a vulnerability, where a csv file triggers the execution of a formula, stored in a cell. Formulas in cells starts usually with `=`, and may also use `+`, `-`, `@`, tabulation and carriage return.

Depending on the opening spreadsheet software, various targets may be achieved, ranging from sending local data to a remote server, to take over the computer. 

CSV injections rarely target PHP itself, as it is not a spreadsheet, nor support formulas in CSV files. Also, components such as `PHPspreadsheet` are able to run a wide range of formulas. 

PHP may relay an injection by saving it in a CSV file.

.. _dangling-reference:

Dangling Reference
------------------

In a foreach loop, a variable is used for looping through the array. When this variable is configured as a reference, the reference survives after the end of the loop. When this variable is reused later, it applies to the last element of the array and overwrites its value.

This doesn't happen when the second loop doesn't use a reference. 

It is recommended to unset the referenced variable, after the loop. It destroys the reference, not the value.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $array = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
   
   foreach($array as &$x) { 
   	// doSomething() or even do nothing! 
   }
   
   // second loop, no reference
   foreach($array as $x) { 
   	// doSomething() or even do nothing! 
   }

.. _deep-clone:

Deep clone
----------

A deep clone is an object cloning, where the cloned object also clone its own object properties. This prevents the original object to share data with the cloned one, yet it is slower to process.

Deep cloning is achieved by using the ``__clone`` magic method. By default, PHP does shallow clone.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class Dog {
       private $name = '';
       private Address $address;
   
       function __construct(string $name, Address $address) {

.. _default-parameter:

Default Parameter
-----------------

Methods may define a default value for parameters. That way the parameter may be omitted during the call, and this value will be used. 

The default value may be a static expression, and, since PHP 8.1, also include new expression. 

The default parameter must be the last of the parameters : adding a parameter without default value after one will yield an error and mess up the call parameters.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   function makeCodffe($type = 'latte') {
       return Making a cup of $latte;

.. _default-value:

Default Value
-------------

Default value is the value that a parameter or a property takes when it is used for the first time, and have not been provided. 

Arguments and properties may have a default value. That way, arguments may be skipped when the method is being called, and the properties do not have to be initialized before usage.

Variable have a default value of null. Their initial assignament is considered a default value, as it replaces the `null` one. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   function foo($a = 1) {
       echo $a;
   }

define()
--------

define() is a PHP function, that introduces constant definitions. 

define() is a function, and may be called anywhere. It is slower than `const`, as it is only executed at runtime. define() doesn't allow class constants creation.

define() used to create case-insensitive constant, but this was abandoned in PHP 7.3.

.. _dereferencing:

Dereferencing
-------------

Dereferencing is the action to access a value, which is referenced with a pointer. Since PHP has no pointer per se, dereferencing applies to accessing an element in an array or an object. 

Dereferencing is also possible to function and methods calls : when a function returns an array or an object, it is possible to immediately access one of the element by using the array or method syntax.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $array = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
   
   echo $array['b'];
   
   function foo() {

.. _destructor:

Destructor
----------

The destructor is a special method in a class, which is called at shutdown of an object, in order to do any last minute cleaning. 

Most of the time, the destructor is automatic : removing scalar values may be sufficient. In cases of resources, or other objects, it is recommended to issue the graceful commands to shut them down in turn. 

Destructors are usually called after the end of the script, and will not have access to any display. As such, calls to echo are ineffective.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class X {
       private $file;

.. _do-while:

Do While
--------

Do While is a loop structure. It runs the block of code until the condition is not met anymore. The block is run once before the condition is checked, so it is always run at least once.

Part of the block execution may be skipped by using the `continue` keyword. 

 

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   /*
   do {
   	// the block
   } while(condition);
   */
   
   $i = 1;
   do {

.. _dry:

DRY : don't repeat yourself
---------------------------

"Don't repeat yourself" (DRY) is a principle of software development aimed at reducing repetition of software patterns.

The concept was coined in Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas's book The Pragmatic Programmer, in 1999.

`Documentation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself>`__

.. _dto:

DTO
---

DTO stands for Data Transfer Object : it is an object that carries data between methods. 

DTO is a class, and replaces arrays advantageously ; it has declared properties, with specified names; it may be used for typing, and hold methods.

.. _duck-typing:

Duck Typing
-----------

In duck typing, an object is of a given type if it has all methods and properties required by that type.

.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
   
   interface i {
   	function foo() ; 
   }
   
   // class X doesn't implement i, yet it is of type i because it implements foo()
   class X {
   	function foo() {}
   	function bar() {}

.. _dynamic-call:

Dynamic Call
------------

A dynamic call happens when part of the syntax comes from a variable, and is not known at code writing time.

In PHP, every syntax may use a dynamic call.



.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
   
   $constant = Name;
   echo constant($constant); 
   echo constant(someClass::$constant); 
   
   $variable = 'a';
   $a = 'b';
   echo $$variable; // b
   
   $function = 'mine';
   $function($arg);
   
   $className = '\stdclass';
   new $className;
   
   $method = 'method';
   $object->$method();

.. _dynamic-class:

Dynamic Class
-------------

A dynamic class is a class whose fully qualified name is defined at execution time. 

This is convenient for module systems, where the actual class is named from an external configuration.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class AB {}
   
   class AC {}
   
   $name = '\A'.(rand(0, 1) ? 'B' : 'C');
   
   $object = new $name;
   
   ?>


Related : :ref:`new <new>`

.. _dynamic-constant:

Dynamic Constant
----------------

A constant is dynamic when its name is a piece of data, and is only access at execution time. 

Calling a constant is done by using the constant() function. 

Sometimes, dynamic constants are also called variable constants. 

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   const A = 1;
   
   $a = 'A';
   
   echo constant($a); // displays 1
   
   ?>

.. _dynamic-loading:

Dynamic Loading
---------------

Dynamic Loading is related to the loading of PHP extensions, at execution time. 

Most of the time, the extensions are compiled with PHP, and loaded at startup. For development purposes, or for distribution purposes, some libraries may be loaded at execution time, with the dl() function.

Dl() calls are considered bad for performances and for security. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
       // add extra features to PHP
       dl('ldap.so');
   ?>
   


`Documentation <https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.dl.php>`__

.. _dynamic-property:

Dynamic Properties
------------------

Dynamic properties are properties created on the fly, without previous definition. 

When the class implements the magic methods __get() and __set(), of if the class extends stdclass, then no warning is emitted.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class X {
       private $property = 1;
       
       function foo() {
           // dynamic property
           $this->a = 1;
           
           // dynamic property with variable name 
           $b = abc;
           $this->$b = 1; 
           
           // static property
           $this->property = 1;

.. _dynamic-variable:

Dynamic Variable
----------------

A dynamic variable is a variable whose name stored in a variable or an expression. 

They are identified by a double $ sign, though the same operator may be used multiple times. 

They are also called variable variable. 

.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
   
   $a = 'b';
   $b = 'c';
   $c = 'd';

.. _ellipsis:

Ellipsis
--------

Ellipsis operator is the `...` operator. It also bears the name of three dots, and even dot dot dot. 

It is used to implements the array spread feature, and the variadic arguments. The actual feature depends on the context. 

Ellipsis is the classic punctuation description of the operator, and will apply to both features.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $array = [1, 2, 3];
   $more = [...$array, 4, 5];

Empty
-----

Empty is a language structure, which determines whether a variable is empty. 

A variable is considered empty if it does not exist or if its value equals false. This may overlap with the usage of isset().


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // True
   var_dump(empty($a));
   
   $b = [];

Encoding
--------

Encoding is the way characters are organized to hold a meaning while being transmitted, stored or manipulated. 

Encoding applies to PHP scripts, which should be UTF-8 encoded, although it might support other formats.

Encoding applies to incoming and outgoing data.

Encoding operations are provided with mb_string, iconv and intl extensions. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   $text = "This is the Euro symbol '€'.";
   
   echo 'Original : ', $text, PHP_EOL;
   echo 'TRANSLIT : ', iconv("UTF-8", "ISO-8859-1//TRANSLIT", $text), PHP_EOL;
   echo 'IGNORE   : ', iconv("UTF-8", "ISO-8859-1//IGNORE", $text), PHP_EOL;

.. _error-handler:

Error Handler
-------------

The PHP error handler is a method that manages errors when they arise, instead of the default PHP handler. 

The error handler is set with the set_error_handler() function. 

The error handler is convenient to translate errors, handle custom levels of errors, or convert errors to exceptions. 

There is a separate exception handler. 

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   set_error_handler('customErrorHandler');
   
   function customErrorHandler($errno, $errstr, $errfile, $errline, array $errcontext)
   {
   	// Handles @ error suppression
   	if (error_reporting === 0)
   	{
   		return false;
   	}
   
   	throw new Exception($errstr, 0, $errno, $errfile, $errline);

.. _error-reporting:

Error Reporting
---------------

Error reporting is both a feature, a directive and a PHP native function. They all cover the same concept.

Error reporting is the way PHP display errors are they are detected during execution. The error_reporting() function and the error_reporting direcitve sets the type of error to be reported : errors are of different types (Warning, Notice, Error, etc.)

While error reporting sets the type of reported error, the display of error is handled by different directives : display_errors and html_errors.

Exceptions are not covered by the error reporting, even though one of the exception is called Error.

Error reporting may be further configured with an error handler function. 

Error may be trigger manually with the trigger_error() function.

.. _escape-character:

Escape Character
----------------

Escape characters are special characters, that introduce a special meaning, for example when redacting an escape sequence.

Escape characters are often generating a special sequence to escape themselves and allow their literal meaning to be expressed.

In PHP's strings and HEREDOC, the escape character is the backslash : \



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   echo <a href="https://www.exakat.io/" />
   
   ?>


`Documentation <https://www.php.net/manual/en/regexp.reference.escape.php>`__

See also `String literals (MySQL) <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/string-literals.html>`_

.. _escape-data:

Escape Data
-----------

Escaping data is a method to write data in a neutral syntax for a target technology. 

For example, angular brackets and quotes are special characters for HTML : to display them without their actual HTML meaning, they have to be escaped as HTML entities, such as &quote or &gt;. 

Escaping applies to technologies which mix raw strings and executable expression : SQL, CSV, HTML, LDAP, etc. 

Escaping data replace some symbols with a longer sequence of symbols. The escaping is made with a special character, which must itself be escaped. For example, CSV escapes anti-slash with a double anti-slash.

PHP supports escape sequences for characters in a string. This is the same concept of escaping data : there, the target includes portability.



`Documentation <https://owasp-top-10-proactive-controls-2018.readthedocs.io/en/latest/c4-encode-escape-data.html>`__

Related packages : ` <https://packagist.org/packages/>`_

.. _escape-sequence:

Escape Sequences
----------------

Escape sequences are sequences of characters with a special meaning. Most of the time, the literal value of the character displayed is its meaning, while, sometimes, there are other hidden meaning.

An escape sequence is dedicated to a technology, and they are rare the same between two technologies, or even, between two engines dedicated to that technology.

Examples of escape sequences ; 

PHP, in strings: 
  + \n (new line)
  + \t (horizontal tabulation)
  + "  (double quote, inside a double quoted-string)
  + "  This is not an escape sequence : single quoted string do not recognize this
  + \u{01f418} : a unicode codepoint, representing an elephpant
  + \200 : a character in octal notation
  + \x69 : a character in hexadecimal notation

HTML : 
 + &acute; (a acute accent)
 + &quote; (double quote)

Escape sequences should not be confused with escape characters, though they are related : some escape sequences are introduced by an escape character. Others rely on a format. 
 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // \1 is an escape sequence that represents the first capturing parenthsis. 
   // It is a special meaning for REGEX.
   preg_match('/(.)\1/', $string);
   
   // Displays AA
   echo "A\101";

.. _eval:

Eval()
------

The eval() function executes a string as a PHP code.

eval() has been used originally to obtain features that PHP did not offer. Nowadays, those features are rare enough that it is recommended to find a safe alternative, before relying on it.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $name = 'v';
   $value = 'vvvv';
   
   // Set a variable with a dynamic name

Exception Handler
-----------------

The exception handler is a default or custom function, which is called once an exception has exhausted all available try-catch blocks.

The execution stops once the handler has been called : as such, it is possible to log or display information related to debugging. 

The exception handler is different from the try/catch block : the latter allows the execution to carry on, when the exception is processed.



.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
   function exception_handler(Throwable $exception) {
     echo "Uncaught exception: " , $exception->getMessage(), "\n";

.. _extends:

extends
-------

`extends` is an operator of the class inheritence. It indicates that a class is built from another one, or an interface is built from another interface. As such, the properties, constants and methods of the parent class or interface are available to the newly created class, unless when they are marked with `private` visiblity. 

`extends` is optional. 

`extends` is unique with a class : it is not possible to extends several classes at the same time. 

`extends` may be multiple with interfaces.

`extends` has a different mechanism than `implements` : `implements` provide method signature but no implementation; `extends` provides both. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class x {
   	function foo() { echo X; }
   }
   
   class y extends x { }
   
   // Both methods are possible 
   (new x)->foo();
   (new y)->foo();
   
   ?>

.. _extension:

Extensions
----------

Extensions are PHP module system. They are compiled into PHP, and offer extra features, such as functions, classes, traits and directive.

Extensions are published in the PECL repository. Some are available by default, in the PHP standard configuration. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // Example with the ext/pspell extensions, for orthographic checks
   $pspell = pspell_new(en);
   
   if (pspell_check($pspell, testt)) {
       echo This is a valid spelling;
   } else {
       echo Sorry, wrong spelling;
   }
   ?>
   


`Documentation <https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.pecl.php>`__

Added in PHP 7.0

.. _extract:

extract()
---------

extract() is a native PHP function, which creates arrays from an array containing variables and their values.

extract() has option to handle situations where the variables are already existing, and how those conflicts should be handled : by default, it overwrites the local variables.

Options are :  ``EXTR_OVERWRITE``, ``EXTR_SKIP``, ``EXTR_PREFIX_SAME``, ``EXTR_PREFIX_ALL``, ``EXTR_PREFIX_INVALID``, ``EXTR_IF_EXISTS``, ``EXTR_PREFIX_IF_EXISTS``, ``EXTR_REFS``.

This function is the opposite of compact().


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $a = 0; // $a is getting overwritten
   $array = extract(['a' => 1, 'b' => 2]);
   
   echo $a + $b; // 2
   ?>

.. _facade:

Facade
------

A facade provides a simplified interface to a complex library. The facade hides the complexity, and iron out some of the dirty details away from the user. 

Facades tends to ease the initial understanding of the library. Later, it limits expert usage and introduce unexpected behavior in the code. 

The Laravel framework is known for its intensive usage of facades.

.. _false:

False
-----

false has two usages, as PHP keyword : the opposite of true, as a boolean value and a special type for functions that may return a boolean, but not true. 

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   function foo($a) : false|A {
       if ($a == 1) {
           return false;

.. _upload:
.. _file-upload:

File Upload
-----------

PHP is able to receive files as part of a form submission. 

PHP is capable of receiving file uploads from any RFC-1867 compliant browser. 

File upload code is based on the $_FILES superglobale, and move_uploaded_file() function. It also relies on several PHP directives :  ``file_uploads``, ``upload_max_filesize``, ``upload_tmp_dir``, ``post_max_size`` and ``max_input_time``. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   $uploaddir = '/var/www/uploads/';
   $uploadfile = $uploaddir . basename($_FILES['userfile']['name']);
   
   echo '<pre>';
   if (move_uploaded_file($_FILES['userfile']['tmp_name'], $uploadfile)) {
       echo 'File is valid, and was successfully uploaded.';
   } else {
       echo 'Possible file upload attack!';

Final Keyword
-------------

The final keyword prevents child classes from overriding a method or a constant by prefixing the definition with final.

The final keyword cannot be used with the private keyword : a private method is not visible in the child classes, and can't also be redefined.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class x {
       final const X = 1;

Finally
-------

Finally is the default clause of a try-catch expression. It is run after all the catch clauses have been called.

Finally is run every time after a try, with or without any catch clause. It is also run before the return expression, if any. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php

.. _for:

For
---

For is a loop structure. It is configured with an initialization expression, a terminaison expression and an increment expression. 

The for() loop executes the init expression first, and only once. Then it executes the block, the increment and the terminaison. When the terminaison is false, it exits the loop.

The initialization, terminaison and increment expression may all host several instructions : they have to be separated by comma, rather than semi colons.

Part of the block execution may be skipped by using the `continue` keyword. 

 

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   /*
   for(initialization; terminaison; increment) {
   	block
   }
   */

.. _foreach:

Foreach
-------

Foreach is the most popular loop in PHP. 

The foreach() loop uses all the elements of the source, and assign them to the blind variable. By default, only the value is assigned; when using the `$key => $value` syntax, the key is also assigned. Then the block is executed with the assigned values. 

Part of the block execution may be skipped by using the `continue` keyword. 

The value may be a reference : then it actually references the original value, which then may be modified in the source. Do not forget to unset referenced variables after the loop, to avoid the dangling reference syndrom, when the last value is changed.

The value may be an array, collecting several values at the same time.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   /*
   foreach($source as $key => $value) {
   	// block
   }
   */
   
   foreach([11,12,13] as $id => $value) {
       print "$id => $value\n";
       // 0 => 11
       // 1 => 12
       // 2 => 13
   }
   
   foreach([[21,22], [33, 34]] as [$a, $b]) {

Form
----

A form is a web page component to collect and submit information. 

The form submits the information using HTTP protocol, and the GET or POST method. It is generally processed by the browser.

The form defines variable, whose content is submitted to the PHP script. Those values are accessed with $_GET, $_POST, $_REQUEST.

Form is an HTML element, in a web page. As such, it may be created by PHP, when PHP produces HTML documents.

---------

A framework is a library that helps building PHP applications, mostly web, but also CLI. Frameworks provide commonly features, such as forms, authentications, templating, arguments and security. 

Frameworks are often described as a platform : they stand as a layer above PHP, with its own conventions and behaviors. PHP is the language of the framework, and the language used to extends the framework.

.. _garbage-collection:
.. _gc:

Garbage Collection
------------------

Garbage collection is a PHP mechanism that checks memory and frees it when it needs to store new values. 

PHP allocate memory as it needs, when variables and objects are created in the code. Sometimes, those variables are destroyed, using explicit unset() calls, or implicitely, when leaving a method or destroying an object. 

To speed up the process, PHP postpone memory cleaning until the end of the application, or when it reaches some internal threshold. Then, it review all the currently allocated variables, and when they are not used anymore (aka, when the reference counter is down to 0), it removes them.

Since garbage collection requires pausing the execution, PHP only runs it on-demand (via gc_collect_cycles() calls), or once every 10k objects to clear.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // Explicit Garbage Collection 
   gc_collect_cycles();
   
   // implicit garbage collection
   // well,... difficult to illustrate, right?
   
   ?>

.. _generator:

Generator
---------

Generators provide an easy way to implement simple iterators without the overhead or complexity of implementing a class that implements the Iterator interface.

Generator must have no return typehint, or use the \Generator typehint.

   <?php
   
   function evenIntegers() {
       for ($i = 0; $i < 10; ++$i) {

.. _generics:

Generics
--------

Generics are a style of types, where the type of a property, parameter or return is specified at the declaration level. 

The generics syntax looks like : `$users = new List<User>();` where `List` is a class that holds a list of items, and those items are of the type between brackets. Here, it is `User`.

Generics allows the creation of general classes, that can process several types of data. The actual application's type is declared in the type itself. This is similar to configure an array to only handle one type of elements.

Generics have been submitted as RFC since 2016, and are currently not implemented, in the forseeable future. 

One implementation of generics is available, with transpiling : see `mrsuh/php-generics`

Hard Coded
----------

Hard coded data in code happens when a value is set as a literal in the code, and can't be change through any directives or parameters.

Hard-code becomes a security problem, when the hard-coded value is a password or a hash of it. This secret is now readable in the code.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php 
   
   // This is hard-coded
   $a = 1;
   
   // $b has a default value, but may also be changed at execution time

.. _hash:

Hash
----

Hash has severeal meanings : 

+ PHP extension
+ PHP function
+ a general computer science concept, that transforms data into another value
+ a general computer science concept, that turns a string into another fixed-sized string, in a way that is difficult to revert
+ a synonym for arrays with arbitrary keys, also known as map or associative array

Hash allows direct or incremental processing of arbitrary length messages using a variety of hashing algorithms. 

While the extension 'hash' only process hashes, there are other extensions which offer these features : openssl, sodium and password hashing. Mhash and mcrypt are older PHP extensions, which are now discontinued. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
   
   echo hash('ripemd160', 'The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.');
   // produces ec457d0a974c48d5685a7efa03d137dc8bbde7e3

.. _hash-comparison:

Hash Comparisons
----------------

Cryptographic hashes are usually represented by strings in PHP. As such, they are subjects to type juggling, and they should be compared with the identity operator, or a dedicated function.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   $expected  = crypt('12345', '$2a$07$usesomesillystringforsalt$');
   $correct   = crypt('12345', '$2a$07$usesomesillystringforsalt$');
   $incorrect = crypt('apple', '$2a$07$usesomesillystringforsalt$');
   
   var_dump(hash_equals($expected, $correct));
   var_dump(hash_equals($expected, $incorrect));
   
   var_dump($expected == $correct));
   var_dump($expected == $incorrect));
   
   var_dump($expected === $correct));
   var_dump($expected === $incorrect));

.. _hash-function:

Hash() function
---------------

A cryptographic hash is an algorithm which maps a string to a fixed sized string, with a method that is difficult to revert.

Some famous algorithm : MD5, SHA1, SHA256, HAVAL, Bcrypt.

Other algorithms include crc32(), though it is not considered a cryptography. 

While the extension 'hash' only process hashes, there are other extensions which offer these features : openssl, sodium and password hashing. Mhash and mcrypt are older PHP extensions, which are now discontinued.

.. _heredoc:

Heredocs
--------

Heredoc is a string syntax, similar to nowdoc, with internal variable interpolation. They behave like double quoted strings.

The Heredocs syntax uses an arbitrary delimiter. The same delimiter will mark the end of the string.

Heredocs are convenient for large amount of text, that has to be hardcoded. Smaller string will be better suited with double quotes, while even longer text should be processed with a templating system.

It is possible to indent the text in a nowdocs string: to avoid this indentation to be passed at execution time, the final delimiter may be indented too. Its indentation will be removed from the parsed text.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $heredoc = <<<DELIM
   This is a long text.
   
   $variable will not be replaced, and the text stays intact.
   
   DELIM;
   
   $heredoc = <<<DELIM
       This is an indented text.
       DELIM;
   
   ?>

.. _hexadecimal-integer:
.. _hexadecimal:

Hexadecimal Integer
-------------------

Hexadecimal integers are integers with an hexadecimal representation. Their value is the same, yet their are written in a different way than the common decimal. 

Hexadecimal has native support in PHP with the ``0x123`` format. There is also support for hexadecimal characters, inside double-quote strings, with the ``\xhh`` syntax.

There are functions to convert from and to hexadecimal format : hexdec(), dechex() and base_convert(), from ten to sixteen.

PHP also has special syntax for binary and octal numbers. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
       $twenty    = 0x14;
       $twentyToo = 20;

.. _http-header:

HTTP headers
------------

HTTP headers are extra information, exchanged between the server and the client, to configure further the network transaction. 

They are separated from the content, which usually represents the HTML page, or the binary  code of the image, archive. 

HTTP headers have a name, and a value. They are made of ASCII text, and separated by a colon `:`

HTTP headers are the same with HTTPS.

In PHP, they are handled by the functions prefixed by `header_` : headers_sent(), headers_list(), header(), header_remove(), header_register_callback()


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   function foo($a, $b) {

.. _identical:

Identical operator
------------------

Identical is the state of two variables, which contains the same data, with the same type. It is the same as equality, without the type-juggling.

Identical operators are `===`, `!==`. The match() command also uses identical comparisons.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   var_dump(0 == 0000); // true
   var_dump(0 === 0);   // false

.. _if-then:

If Then Else
------------

A if-then-else command branches the execution based on an condition. When the condition is true, the first branche, called `then` is executed. When the condition is false, the second branch, called `else`, is executed. 

If-then structures may be chained with the `elseif` keyword. The else branch is then a new if-then structure, with a second condition. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $number = rand(0, 10);
   
   if ($number % 2 === 0) {

.. _iffectation:

Iffectation
-----------

An iffection is both an assignation and a condition at the same time. 

Assignation is a condition is debated. It makes the code less readable, as the assignation is hidden in the if condition.

It also saves some extra lines of code, when the condition applies to something that will immediately be used. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   if ($x = foo()) { }
   
   // same, without the iffectation
   $x = foo();

.. _immutable:

Immutable
---------

An immutable object is an object that can't be changed. It may be created, read and cloned. On the other hand, a mutable object may change when one of its method is called, even if this is not visible from the outside.

Immutable objects are thread-safe. 

Immutable objects often return a clone version of themself after a modification. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
   
   class x {
   	private $x = 0;
   	
   	function inc() : self {
   		$return = clone $this;
   		$return->x +=1;
   		
   		return $return;

.. _include:

Inclusion
---------

Inclusion is the process to read an external file, and evaluate with the current application for execution. It may define new structures, and execute code. 

Inclusion relies on four language structures : include, require, include_once, require_once. 

Inclusion is often hidden in autoload() functions : the code is included class per class, upon request. 



.. code-block:: php
   
    vars.php
   <?php
   
   $color = 'green';
   $fruit = 'apple';

.. _incoming-data:

Incoming Data
-------------

Incoming data are data submitted to PHP by the user. They may come in different way : GET, POST, cookies or files; and, by extension, $_REQUEST. 

Incoming data should always be checked before usage. Their value may have been modified by the author of the source, and carry some malicious payload.

The encoding of the incoming data are controled with the `default_charset` directive.

By extension, incoming data may be used to every source of data that is not PHP itself : files, databases, API, etc. Then, they should be treated the same way, with checks on format and value before usage. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
   
   if ($_GET['x'] === '1') {
   	print "You provided a one digit. Thanks!";

.. _index:

Index
-----

A index is the identifier of an specific element in an array. They may automatically generated, by simply omitting them at creation time. 

PHP index may be integers or strings only. Other data types generate an error or a type conversion. For example, floats are turned into integer. integer-shaped strings will also be turned into integer.

PHP index start at 0. They may be automatically assigned by appending a new value with the `[]` operator : then, they use the greatest available index + 1.


.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
       $array = ['a', 'b', 'c'];

.. _inequality:

Inequality
----------

Inequalities are the mathematical comparison of values, with the `>`,  `>=`,  `<` and `=<` operators. 

Unlike the equality operators, they do not have a strict version, which takes into account the type of the values. Hence, the compared values are always adapted to each other's type.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // displays false

Injection is the usage of a resource (data, object, services...) that is provided to the method, by the caller.

There are good injections, as the dependency injection.

There are bad injections : all the security ones. SQL injection, PHP code injection, CSV injection, XML injection, etc. Those attempt to change reroute the execution of the method to gain access to unprotected resources.

Internationalization
--------------------

Internationalization is the process to make the human interface of a program in a local language. 

PHP includes some internationalization capabilities, via the locale, for dates or money format, or with the ext/intl extension. 

Most of the interface translations for application is done with specific components, such as `Symfony/translation`. Translation of interface messages is part of this concept.

Internationalization is also called `i18n`, aka i, 18 letters and n. This is shorter to write. This word may be written with a z or an s, depending on the flavor of English being used.

.. _intl:

Internationalization Functions
------------------------------

The internationalization extension performs operations with locales. For example, it formats dates according to country and language configurations. The operations include, and are not limited to, formatting, transliteration, encoding conversion, calendar operations, » UCA-conformant collation, locating text boundaries and working with locale identifiers, timezones and graphemes.

This extension is closely linked to the ICU library. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   $us = new NumberFormatter('en_US', NumberFormatter::DECIMAL);
   echo $us->format(1234567).PHP_EOL;
   //1,234,567
   
   $zh = new NumberFormatter('zh_ZH', NumberFormatter::DECIMAL);
   echo $zh->format(1234567).PHP_EOL;
   //1,234,567
   
   $fr = new NumberFormatter('fr_FR', NumberFormatter::DECIMAL);

.. _language-construct:

Language construct
------------------

PHP has 'language construct', which are special keywords, with an attached feature. 

Language constructs are : echo, require, require_once, include, include_once, return, die, exit, unset, isset, print, empty.

Language constructs usually do not require parenthesis, and they are mostly known for that. The parenthesis is not necessary, but possible. It makes the language construct look like a function call. 

Also, language construct do not behave like a function, so they can't be used by their name, as a callback. 

There have some special behavior : echo accepts an arbitrary number of argument, while print only accepts one. die and exit work without arguments, but, in the event that an argument is provided, it must be enclosed in parenthesis.

.. _letter-logical:

Letter Logical Bug
------------------

PHP offers two sets of operators for logical operations : the letter operators (and, or, xor) and the symbol operators (&&, ||, no xor in symbol).

While they do the same, those operators have a difference : they do not share the same precedence. In particular, && has higher priority than = while = has higher priority than and. This leads to a difference in execution.

When combining = and &&, the logical operation happens before the assignation; while combinins = and and actually igmore the logical operation.

The same problem affect yield, yield from, print, all assignations, including the short assignations, the ternary operator and the null-coalesce. 

It is recommended to always use the symbol logical operators, which is closer to human expectations. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $a = 1 && 3;
   
   $b = 1 and 3;
   // equivalent to 
   ($b = 1) and 3;

.. _linting:
.. _lint:

Linting
-------

Linting is the process to turn the Text file that holds the source code, into tokens. During this first phase, PHP applies some checks, and report anything that makes no sense.

After linting, the code is processed further before reaching the status of opcode, where it can be executed. 

Linting is an option of the PHP CLI : `-l`. 

Linting is sometimes mistaken with 'compiling' : linting is a part of a compilation. Since, it is the only step available in PHP between the code and the execution (with eval() or the PHP CLI), linting is often considered as compiling.

.. _list:

List
----

List() acts as the contrary to array() : it will break an array into individual elements, and assign them to the arguments of the list. 

List() also has a short array version, which is `[ ]` the square brackets. Those square brackets are only appearing on the left side of an assignation. 

list() may omit extracted values by skipping their value, and leaving seemingly empty arguments. List() also supports double-arrow notation, where the key is provided. 

list() may be nested. It may also be used with foreach() structures.

list() looks like a function, though it is the only one to appears on the left part of an assignation, and is actually a language-construct.

A list is also the name given to arrays where the index are the automatic ones. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   list($a, $b, $c) = [1,2,3];
   
   [$a, , [$c]] = [1,2,[3],4];

Locale are a set of configuration which describe how to handle different formats of data, such as monetary values, dates and time.

Locales are extracted from the system, and depends on a country name and a language name. For example, `fr-FR` for French French, `nl_NL` for Dutch, or `zh_CN` for Chinese Chinese. 

Locale are supported with the ext/icu extension, and also, natively with the setlocale() function.

Logical operators
-----------------

Logical operators applies four logical functions to booleans. 

+ ``and`` and ``&&``
+ ``or`` and ``||``
+ ``xor`` (no symbolic version for ``xor``)
+ ``!``  (no letter version for ``not``)

The logical operators are either symbolic or letter. Be aware that the symbolic operators have a higher precedence than the letter one, in particular vis-à-vis comparisons.

The logical operators work on various types, and output booleans. They are different from the bitwise operators, which work on the value as a bit level, not as a whole.

.. _magic-constant:

Magic Constants
---------------

Constants which hold information about the current location of the code.

Those constants are magic, because they have a constant syntax, yet their value may change, even during the execution of the code. 

+ __LINE__	The current line number of the file.
+ __FILE__	The full path and filename of the file with symlinks resolved. If used inside an include, the name of the included file is returned.
+ __DIR__	The directory of the file. If used inside an include, the directory of the included file is returned. This is equivalent to dirname(__FILE__). This directory name does not have a trailing slash unless it is the root directory.
+ __FUNCTION__	The function name, or {closure} for anonymous functions.
+ __CLASS__	The class name. The class name includes the namespace it was declared in (e.g. Foo\Bar). When used in a trait method, __CLASS__ is the name of the class the trait is used in.
+ __TRAIT__	The trait name. The trait name includes the namespace it was declared in (e.g. Foo\Bar).
+ __METHOD__	The class method name.
+ __NAMESPACE__ The name of the current namespace.

Those constants are case insensitive. All those syntax will work : `__METHOD__`, `__method__`, `__meTHod__`.

.. _magic hash:

Magic Hash
----------

A magic hash is a hash string which is mistakenly compared to another hash. 

In the example below, the same MD5 hash is taken for two distinct strings, which ends up being identical, per `==`. 

In reality, the two hashes are different strings : `0e462097431906509019562988736854` and `0e830400451993494058024219903391` respectively. When they are compared, as strings, PHP identifies the initial 0 of the strings, and assume the comparison should be an integer comparison.

Each string is turned into a int, which are 0 in both cases. Hence, the comparison succeeds, yet it wrong.

The protection against magic hashes is to use the identity operator `===`, rather than the equality. It makes a type comparison and do not apply type juggling, which leads to the two hashs above different. 

This example is applicable with any hash algorithm which produces a string that starts with 0. Check the magic hash repository for examples with SHA256, HAVAL, PHOTON, RIPEMD or SPONGENT.

There are PHP functions and operators that perform safe comparisons ,such as `===`, `!==` and hash_equals().

Magic Property
--------------

Special properties, which are not declared, but dynamically handled by the magic methods. They do not have specific declaration. 

The magic methods to handle magic properties are :  __get(), __set(), __isset() and __unset().

Map
---

A map is an associative array. In PHP, this feature is supported by array. 

PHP's array syntax supports a feature to assign the index an arbitrary key. 

Maps are also called associative array, or hashes.

.. _max_execution_time:

max_execution_time
------------------

The `max_execution_time` directive sets the maximum amount of time that PHP will work on an application. 

The default value is 30 seconds. It may be lowered down to 1 second, or set to infinity with -1.

`max_execution_time` may be changed from the code with set_time_limit(). This function may also be disabled, and not available.

It is recommended to set this value as low as possible, and optimize the code to run below that limit.



`Documentation <https://www.php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.max-execution-time>`__

.. _memoization:

Memoization
-----------

Memoization is an optimisation technique to speed up a function by avoiding re-processing previously calculated results. 

Usually, memoization trades processing time with memory. The best suited situation are when the load takes some time to process, and the result is a small amount of memory, such as a count. 

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   function docs($file) {
       // local cache 
       static $cache = [];
       
       // If it was already cached, use it. 
       // Docs are supported to be constant during the execution
       if (isset($cache[$file])) {
           return $cache[$file];
       }
       
       $cache[$file] = file_get_contents($file) ?? '';

   <?php
   
   class x {
       public function foo() {
           echo "I am foo!\n";

.. _migration:

Migration
---------

Migration is the incremental upgrade of a piece of code. 

It is often used for databases, for example, with Laravel database migrations; for components and frameworks : for example, CakePHP migration.

Usually, migration requires some action from the user, although a migration script may be provided.

Migration may also be called upgrades.

.. _mock:

Mock
----

A mock replaces a code dependency with an object, to make testing easier. Mocks are used when the dependency is difficult to set in a reproducable state : for example, in a rare state, or after a long set up.

Mocks turns the dependency into another piece of code, with total control over its behavior. 

On the other hand, mocks have to be coded to replace the dependency, and emulates its behavior as closely as possible : any change to the dependency behavior has to be backported. 

Mock objects are also called `test double`.

An array inside an array is called a multidimensional array. Dimensions may be created as many as necessary, by using the square brackets.

PHP creates the arrays on the fly. When the intermediate array are undefined, PHP will add them in the structure.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $a = array(1 => array('a' => 1));
   
   $a[1][b]['c'] = 3;

.. _mutation-test:

Mutation Testing
----------------

Mutation testing is a way to enhance the quality of tests by checking how they react to a small perturbation of the code source.

After writing a suite of tests and having it pass, mutation testing adds a modification to the code : for example, replacing a `+` by a `-`. Then, it runs the test suite again, and the expectation is that one test (at least) should spot the error. That way, the code is well bordered by the tests. 

When the suite is still green after mutating the code, this means that the test suite is not sufficient to spot it. The code is now a mutant, and the test suite should be updated.

`Infection` is a PHP mutation Testing framework.

.. _n-query:

N+1 Query
---------

In a foreach loop, a variable is used for looping through the array. When this variable is configured as a reference, the reference survives after the end of the loop. When this variable is reused later, it applies to the last element of the array and overwrites its value.

This doesn't happen when the second loop doesn't use a reference. 

It is recommended to unset the referenced variable, after the loop. It destroys the reference, not the value.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $array = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
   
   foreach($array as &$x) { 
   	// doSomething() or even do nothing! 
   }
   
   // second loop, no reference
   foreach($array as $x) { 
   	// doSomething() or even do nothing! 
   }

.. _named-constructor:

Named Constructors
------------------

Named constructor is a class organisation, where several static factories are created to instantiate the object, based on arguments. They usually prepare the argument, to call the constructor the right way. 

That approaches makes the construction of the object simpler, and reduces the number of conditionals. 

As Matthias Verraes puts it : 'Don't limit yourself by PHP's single constructor. Use static factory methods.'

.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
   
   // parse a single string
   $user = Person::createFromTitle('Mr John Smith');
   
   $user = Person::createFromNames('John', 'Smith');
   
   class Person {
   	// constructor is private, $parameters are not documented
   	private function __constructor( ) {}
   	
   	static public function createFromNames(string $firstName, string $lastName) : self {
   		// assign the argument to the right parameter of the constructor
   	}
   
   	static public function createFromTitle(string $fullName) : self {
   		// parse the string, and calls the constructor
   	}

.. _new:
.. _instantiation:

new
---

new creates a new object from a class. This operation is called the instantiation. 

The class must be available at instantiation call : PHP will search for it in the declared classes, then call the autoloader to find it. In case no class is found, and error is emitted.

The instantiation calls immediately the constructor of the object : it is the method called ``__construct``. 

The constructor defines how many arguments are needed. When no argument is needed, new may also be called without parenthesis.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class x {
       function __construct($a = 1) {}

.. _non-breakable-space:

Non breakable spaces
--------------------

Space is one of the base ascii character. They are often used to separate words, and are forbidden from being used in names. 

PHP supports Unicode characters, and some of the characters are called : non breaking spaces. They behave like a space, by displaying a blank area. Yet, they are recognized internally as a non-space, and can be used in a name.

Non-breakable spaces are useful for tests, as they make the testing name more readable. They are also quite rare, and confusing for newcomers.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // This is a space, it won't compile
   const A B = 1;
   
   // This is a non breakabe space, it compile and is not visibly different from the line above
   const A B = 1;

.. _nowdoc:

Nowdocs
-------

Nowdocs is a string syntax, similar to heredoc, and without internal parsing. They are similar to single quoted strings, compared to double quoted ones.

The Nowdocs syntax uses an arbitrary delimiter, which has to be enclosed in single quotes. The same delimiter will mark the end of the string.

Nowdocs are convenient for large amount of text, that has to be hardcoded. Smaller string will be better suited with single-quotes, while even longer text should be stored in an external storage, such as a file.

It is possible to indent the text in a nowdocs string: to avoid this indentation to be passed at execution time, the final delimiter may be indented too. Its indentation will be removed from the parsed text.
 

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $nowdoc = <<<'DELIM'
   This is a long text.
   
   $variable will not be replaced, and the text stays intact.
   
   DELIM;
   
   $nowdoc = <<<'DELIM'
           This still will start at the first word, not at the beginning of the string.

.. _object-injection:
.. _deserialize-injection:

Object Injection
----------------

Object injection happens when a string is deserialized to recreate an object, inside PHP, while the string is controled by the attacker.

The general synopsis is the following : 
+ PHP serialize an object
+ The serialized string is transmitted to the user, then back to PHP (via cookies, hidden fields, or any storage)
+ PHP deserialize the object

While in the hand of the user, the data was doctored to retain its format validity, but with values that are now controlled by the attacker.

.. _object-invasion:

Object Invasion
---------------

PHP allows objects of one class to access private structures of an object of the same class.

This is useful when cloning or importing objects with __set_state() : within the same class, those methods can create new objects and assign all their properties.

This feature break OOP encapsulation : even when using private visibility, it is possible to access then from outside the object. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
   
   class A {
   	private $p = 0;
   	
   	// accessing a different object
   	function foo(A $a) {
   		$a->p = $this->p;
   	}
   
   	function __set_state($array) {
   		$object = new self();
   		$object->p = $array['p'];
   		
   		return $object;
   	}
   }
   
   ?>

----------------------------

The object nullsafe operator is an operator which gives access to properties and methods of an object.

Depending on the context, those properties and methods must be public or protected.

Object Nullsafe Operator is directly related to the Object operator : the difference is that the former keeps on executing when the support object is null, while the second stops with a fatal error.

Object Relationanl Mapping (ORM)
--------------------------------

Object Relationanl Mapping is a tool that bridges the OOP world to databases (in general, and SQL in particular).

As its definition implies, such tool is able to take data from an object, and place it in a database's table. The transfert may be straightforward, when the object is stored in one table. Or, it may be complex, when the same data are spread over multiple tables. 

PHP has several ORM : Doctrine, Readbean, Eloquent, Propel.

Octal Integer
-------------

Integers can be specified in octal (base 8) notation. Octal integer syntax starts with ``0o`` (zero-o) and only contains digits from 0 to 7.

Initially, octal integers were formatted by simply starting with a initial 0. This features is still available, yet should be replaced with the less confusing syntax with ``0o``.


.. code-block:: php

.. _operator-precedence:

Operator Precedence
-------------------

The operator precedence dictates in which order the operators in a same sequence are executed. 

For example, in the code `1 + 2 * 3`, the order is the mathematical order : multiplication has precedence over addition. The results is 7, not 9. 

In PHP, operators have different predecence : `.` (dot) has a lower priority than addition `+` and `-`.  

Precedence may lead to unexpected behavior. For example, ``-9 ** 2 == -9``, because ``-`` has lower precedence than ``**``, and PHP doesn't parse negative numbers in one pass. 

Also, `$a = $b & $c;` means that `$a = $b;`, because `=` has a higher priority than `&`.



.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
   
   // 7, not 9
   $a = 1 + 2 * 3; 
   
   // 11
   $a = 4 * 2 + 3; 
   
   // equivalent to !($a instanceof aClass)
   // ! has lower precedence than instanceof
   $b = !$a instanceof aClass;
   
   ?>

Operators
---------

An operator is something that takes one or more values (or expressions, in programming jargon) and yields another value (so that the construction itself becomes an expression).

   // not operator, unary
   $a = !$b;
   
   // plus operator

.. _optional-parameter:

Optional Parameter
------------------

Optional parameter are parameter fitted with a default value. They may then be skipped when the function is called. 

Optional parameter should be the last parameters : otherwise, PHP will have trouble figuring out which parameter uses which value.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   function foo($a, $b = 2) { }
   
   // $b will be 2, using the default value
   foo(1); 
   
   // $b will be 3
   foo(1, 3); 
   
   ?>


`Documentation <https://www.php.net/manual/en/functions.arguments.php>`__

.. _outgoing-data:

Outgoing Data
-------------

Outgoing data are data submitted by PHP to an external user. The default may be the user's browser, and the usual formats may be HTML, or JSON. Yet, there are many other destinations, such as databases, files, API, other process and formats, such as CSV, text, PDF, etc.  

Outgoing data should always be formatted with the target technology. For example, text should use HTML entities for HTML output, or be provided as prepared statement with a database. Each target has its own system of protection.

The encoding of the incoming data are controled with the `default_charset` directive.



.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
   
   // raw text, for the browser
   echo Hello world.;

.. _overflow:

Overflow
--------

Overflow happens when a value goes beyond a limit : out of its range of existence, the behavior of the value is now unknown.

Overflow happens with integers (limited to PHP_INT_MAX  and PHP_INT_MIN), floats (PHP_FLOAT_MAX and PHP_FLOAT_MIN). 

Other situations, such as accessing an array element or a string character beyond its last element, defaults to returning `null`.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   $a = PHP_INT_MAX;
   $b = (int) ($a +  1);
   
   echo $a.PHP_EOL;

.. _overwrite:
.. _overloading:

Overwrite
---------

Overwriting is the process to replace a method, property or constant that was defined in a parent, by a local definition. This is related to OOP programming and inheritance.

Overwriting is applicable to constants, methods and properties. Methods still should have a compatible signature with their parent's equivalent, while properties and constants may change their (default) value.

Overwriting is prevented by the ``final`` keyword, or the ``private`` visibility.

Overwriting is also called overloading. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class x {
       const Y = 1;
       const Z = 2;
   }
   
   class xx extends x {
       // Z is inherited, and its value is 2    
       // Y used to be 1, it is now 31

.. _by-reference:

Passing By Reference
--------------------

When calling a method, or returning from it, data may be passed by value or by reference. 

By reference, a reference to the the data is passed : any modification on that value inside the method will be reflected in the original value. 

This is the alternative way of passing data to methods : the default way is to use by value, which copies the data. 

Passing by reference is the default behavior with object. Otherwise, it needs to be declared with the ``&`` operator, in the function signature.

Returned value are passed back to the calling context with the same rule than for parameters.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $a = 0;

Passing By Value
----------------

When calling a method, or returning from it, data may be passed by value or by reference.

This is the default way of passing data to methods : the alternative way is to use by reference. 

Passing by value may be memory-intensive when passing a large array. This is not the case for objects, which are always passed by reference.

Returned value are passed back to the calling context with the same rule than for parameters.

Persistence also applies to database connexion, where the connexion is not closed at the end of the current process, but stays open for the next to reuse it, saving some overhead, but keeping a connexion open even if not busy.

Persistent storage may also be called permanant storage.

PSR are edited by the PHP-FIG : Framework Interoperability Group.

There are 22 PSR at the moment, covering subjects such as cache, factories, log, coding standards,...

.. _php-tag:

PHP tags
--------

When PHP parses a file, it looks for opening and closing tags, which are <?php and ?> which tell PHP to start and stop interpreting the code between them. 

The classic PHP tag is `<?php`, and it also has a short version, for better serving xml tags : `<?`. This one relies on the `short_open_tag` directive.

Previously, PHP supported also Javascript-style and ASP-style tags, though these are now unsupported.


.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
     // This is the classic PHP tag
   
   ?>
   <?
     // This is the short PHP tag
   
   ?><?= Hello world;
     // This is the short echo PHP tag
   
   ?>

.. _php-ug:

PHP User Groups
---------------

PHP-UG are the PHP User Groups. They are informal groups of PHP developer and related, who gather on a regular to irregular schedule. They usually have an organisation time, speakers and various activities. 

`Documentation <https://php.ug/>`__

.. _php-variable:

PHP variables
-------------

PHP provides a large number of predefined variables. They may be super-global, and available in any context, such as `$_GET`, or classic variable, in the global scope, such as `$argv`.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   print_r($_GET);
   print_r($argv);
   print_r($GLOBALS);
   
   function foo() {
       global $argc;
   }

.. _fpm:
.. _php-fpm:

PHP-FPM
-------

FPM stands for FastCGI Process Manager. It is a PHP FastCGI implementation.

Instead of nesting PHP in the webserver, php-fpm makes PHP a server by itself. The web server then delegates the work to the PHP server. The advantage is to lower the memory footprint of PHP and the web server, and the whole of them both. It helps with stability, by keeping the two processes separated.

.. _phpdoc:

PHPdoc
------

PHPDoc is an adaptation of Javadoc for the PHP programming language. It is a formal way to comment certains PHP structures, that is machine readable.

PHPDoc has a special token, to make it easier to extract it from the code.

PHPdoc may be exploited by automated documentation tools, or static analyzer, IDE.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   /**
    * Check if a number is prime
    *
    * @param int     $int       The number to test

.. _phpinfo:

phpinfo()
---------

phpinfo() is one of the most famous PHP function. It outputs information about PHP's configuration, in HTML format. 

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   // Show all information, defaults to INFO_ALL
   phpinfo();

.. _plugin:

Plugin
------

A plugin is a component that add new features to an existing code. 

A plugin is build on top of a framework, and makes usage of it. It may also have its own dependencies.

Plugin is a generic term, and has many variations : component, extensions, module, etc.

.. _plus:

plus +
------

`+` is a native PHP operator, which has three usage : 

+ The addition, as in mathematics. This works on integers and double.
+ The merging of arrays. This merge sets the keys once, then omits the next values.
+ The + sign in front of a number, to make it explicitely positive. This is optional, and may be repeated.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $a = 1 + 2; // 3
   
   $b = [1, 2] + [3, 4, 5]; // [1,2, 5]
   
   ?>


`Documentation <https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.operators.arithmetic.php>`__

.. _portability:

Portability
-----------

Portability is the capacity of a PHP application to run on different platform. 

PHP is quite portable by itself : the vast majority of the codes runs on every plat-forms.

On the other hands, some PHP functions are not available on Windows or Linux; Some extensions are not available on all platforms, such as scoutapm or com. Such non-portable features should not be used, or made optional in code for which portability is important.



.. _positional-parameter:

Positional Parameters
---------------------

Argument which are identified by their position in the signature or the call. This is the traditional way of sending arguments to a method. 

The alternative way is to use named parameters.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   function foo($a, $b) {
       return $a - $b;
   }
   
   echo foo(2, 3);  // return -1
   echo foo(3, 2);  // return 1
   
   echo foo(a: 2, b: 3);  // return -1
   echo foo(b: 2, a: 3);  // return 1
   
   ?>

.. _precedence:

Precedence
----------

Precedence organizes the way operators are executed, when they are mixed in the same expression.

For example, `1 + 2 * 3` will produce `7`, since `*` has a higher precedence than `+`. 

Every operator has a precedence, and when they have the same precedence, the rightmost one yield to the leftmost one.

Precedence offers some reading surprises to human readers. For example, `! $b instanceof \X` really applies `instanceof` first, and `&&` has a higher priority than `and`, even though they perform the same function.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   var_dump(!$b instanceof \X);
   var_dump($a = 1 and 2);
   
   ?>

.. _predefined-constant:

Predefined Constants
--------------------

Predefined constants are PHP native constants, available at the start of the PHP engine. 

Those constants are for internal usage, such as E_ALL, for error reporting, or STDOUT, for output. Some constants are providing information, such as PHP_VERSION's PHP version number. Others are meant to give a readable name to common values or arguments, such as DATE_RFC822. 

Other constants come from extensions : for example, the Math extension defines M_PI for the pi constant (3.14159...), libsodium defines SODIUM_CRYPTO_CORE_RISTRETTO255_SCALARBYTES, etc. Those are also predefined constants, although they depend on the compilation of PHP.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   echo This is PHP.PHP_VERSION;
   
   ?>

Related : :ref:`Constants <constant>`

.. _prepared-query:

Prepared Query
--------------

A prepared query is a compiled query, where data are provided as parameters.

Instead of executing the query at once, the query is compiled first, and placeholders are filled later with the actual data. This prevents injections, as the data and the query are separated.

Most PHP DB extensions support prepared statements. Prepared statement may also be available with other systems than SQL databases, such as Gremlin server. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   // Example from PHP manual
   /* Execute a prepared statement by passing an array of values */
   $sth = $dbh->prepare('SELECT name, colour, calories
       FROM fruit
       WHERE calories < ? AND colour = ?');
   $sth->execute(array(150, 'red'));
   $red = $sth->fetchAll();
   $sth->execute(array(175, 'yellow'));
   $yellow = $sth->fetchAll();
   ?>

.. _preprocess:
.. _preprocessing:

Preprocessing
-------------

Preprocessing is an optimisation technique, where a value is calculated even before the execution of a script. This is only possible with constants values, which are known before execution.

Preprocessing may save execution time, and memory. 

In terms of maintenance, it hides some implementation details in the result : one has to guess where this value is coming from.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $seconds = 60;
   $minutes = 60;
   
   $hours = $seconds * $minutes;
   
   // this variable may be preprocessed, saving the calculation at execution time.
   $hours = 3600;

Private Visibility
------------------

The private keyword is part of the three keywords to define visibility of a method, property or constant. It is the strictest level of visibility : it restrict usage to the current class only. Child class can't redefine it, nor access it.

The private keyword cannot be used with the final keyword : a private method is not visible in the child classes, and can't also be redefined.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class x {
       private const X = 1;

.. _property:

Properties
----------

Class properties are variables, local to an object or a class.

They might have visibility, chosen among : public (default), protected and private.

They might have a default value. By default it is null.

They might have a type, since PHP 7.4

They might be readonly, for properties which are only set once, and cannot be modified. 

They might be static, and not related to an object, but to a class. 

Property should be uniquely defined in a class. They may be redefined in children or parent when the visibility allows it.

.. _readability:

Readability
-----------

A code is readable, or easy to read, if all the needed information is available in the code, without the need to reach for an extra piece of reference to understand it.

Readable code may be understood on the spot, while unreadable code hides some important part of the process. 

Readability is a human characteristic of the code : it depends on the level of knowledge of the reader. Good naming is an important part of readability, as intention are conveyed.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // all explicit alphabet
   $alphabet = array ( 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z');
   
   // readable with knowledge of range() function
   $alphabet = range('a', 'z');
   
   // generic name for a partial list of letter : many questions hang
   $array = range('a', 'l');
   
   ?>


.. _readonly:

Readonly
--------

A property can be declared with the readonly modifier, which prevents modification of the property after initialization.

Readonly also applies inside the __clone() magic method : cloning doesn't allow for changing a readonly property.

In PHP 8.2, a class may be readonly, making all of of its properties readonly too. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class Test {
      public readonly string $prop;
   
      public function __construct(string $prop) {

   }
   
   $test = new Test(foobar);
   // Legal read.
   var_dump($test->prop); // string(6) foobar
   
   // Illegal reassignment. It does not matter that the assigned value is the same.
   $test->prop = foobar;
   // Error: Cannot modify readonly property Test::$prop

.. _recursion:
.. _recursive:

Recursion
---------

Recursion in PHP is a method or a function, which calls itself. 

While the method calls itself, it also must have branch and not call itself : otherwise, the call will never end.

Functions, methods, closures and arrowfunctions may be recursive.

Recursion is an abstract notion : it is also used in the PHP name itself. PHP : Hyperthext Preprocessor.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   function factorial(int $number) { 
       if ($number < 2) { 
           return 1; 
       }
   
       return ($number * factorial($number - 1)); 
   }
   
   // recursive closure
   $factorial = function( $n ) use ( &$factorial ) {
       if( $n == 1 ) return 1;
       return $factorial( $n - 1 ) * $n;

.. _reference-count:

Reference Count
---------------

Reference counting is the way PHP keeps track of the usage of a value.

The count starts at 1 when the value is created, and it is increased when the value is passed around. It is decreased when the value is deleted or modified. When the reference count is zero, the value may be removed from the memory safely. 

Reference counting is a feature of the PHP engine : code usually uses it transparently. The only possible interaction is when using the garbage collector.

Register Globals
----------------

Register globals is an old and removed feature of PHP, which automatically created variables from the incoming super globals, such as $_GET, $_POST, $_REQUEST, $_COOKIES. 

This meant that the initial set of variables in an application was not known, as they would depend on the incoming data. 

Register-globals has been removed in PHP 5.4. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   	// $_GET['foo'] = 'bar';

.. _resource:

resource
--------

A resource is a special type of data, holding a reference to an external resource. Resources are created and used by special functions. 

Resources are only used with their dedicated functions. It is not possible to modify them in any other way.

Resources, in general, are being removed from PHP code and more recent versions tend to rely less on them and more on objects. 

There is a list of PHP resources available in the docs.

   <?php
   
   $fp = fopen('/tmp/test.txt', 'r+');
   var_dump(is_resource($fp));

.. _api:

REST API
--------

REST stands for Representational state transfer. It formalize an interface to access resources that are physically separated.

REST defines four interface constraints:

+ Identification of resources
+ Manipulation of resources
+ Self-descriptive messages
+ Hypermedia as the engine of application state

REST APIs are docmented with OpenAPI (aka, swagger).

.. _return:

Return
------

`return` ends the current method, and sends back a produced value to the calling module. Execution resumes at the expression following the called module's invocation. 

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   function foo() {
       if (rand(0, 1)) {
           return 'tail';

.. _returntypewillchange:

Return Type Will Change
-----------------------

This is a native PHP attribute, which tells the engine that method overwriting some native methods will change the returntype.

To avoid using that attribute, one must made the return type compatible with PHP signatures.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class Foo implements ArrayAccess {
       #[\ReturnTypeWillChange]
       public function offsetGet(mixed $offset) {}

.. _return-typehint:
.. _returntype:

Return Typehint
---------------

Return typehints are the types used for the return values of a method or function. 

They are the same as the argument types, with a few addition : 

+ `void`, which means that no value is returned. (No usage of return, or return with no explicit value)
+ `never`, which means that the function won't return : either it will kill the application, or it will throw an exception.

Return types are ignored when the method throws an exception. 

return typehint are covariant : they get more or equally precise with each new child generation. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   function foo() : bool {
       if (rand(0,1)) {
           return true;
       } else {
           throw new Exception('e');
       }

.. _return-value:

Return Value
------------

Return value is the value returned, at the end of a method call. That value may be typed with a data typehint. It may also be typed with `never`, in case the method doesn't return, or `void`, when the method returns nothing. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   function foo() : int {
       return 1;
   }
   
   function goo() : never {
       throw new Exception(Error);

Rubber Ducking Debugging
------------------------

Rubber Ducking is a debugging technic, where one explains the bug in human language, to a partner. The partner may be a real human, but also, an inanimate object, such as a rubber duck. In the process of explaining, the speaker clarifies the situation and often, get a deeper knowledge. 

The 'rubber duck' reference is mentionned in the 'Pragmatic programmer' book.

Scalar Typehints
----------------

In its simplest form, a yield statement looks much like a return statement, except that instead of stopping execution of the function and returning, yield instead provides a value to the code looping over the generator and pauses execution of the generator function. 

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   function gen_one_to_three() {
       for ($i = 1; $i <= 3; $i++) {

Scope Resolution Operator ::
----------------------------

The Scope Resolution Operator is a token that allows access to static, constant, and overridden properties or methods of a class.

Traditionnally, this used to be a feature of the function get_class(). The operator is more modern and faster. 

This operator is often called double-colon, or `paamayim-nekudotayim` : this is double-colon in hebrew.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $a = new stdClass();

.. _semantics:

Semantics
---------

Semantics is related with the meaning of things. In particular, when naming structures, such as variables, classes, methods, properties, goto labels, use alias, functions or constants, the name should be meaningful. 

While naming doesn't impact the code itself, as names are free, they do have a serious impact on human understanding of the code. 

It is also possible to find inconsistencies between the name and its usage. For example, when a name is used for an unexepected type. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   function foo(User $commenter) { }
   
   // Inconsistence between the parameter name and its type
   function bar(array $string) { }
   
   ?>


.. _semicolon:

Semicolon
---------

Semicolon is used to mark the end of a statement. 

It is also used in the for() statement, to separate the initialization, the terminaison and the increment. When using several statement between those semicolons, they must be separated with a comma.

Semicolons may also be used instead of colons, in a case statement.

Semicolons may be omitted, before a closing PHP tag.



.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
   
   $a = 1; $b = 2;
   
   // multi-statement usage in for()
   for($i = 0, $j = 0; $i < 10; ++$i, ++$j) {

.. _serialization:
.. _serialize:

Serialization
-------------

Serialization is a string representation of an object, that can be stored as text, and then turned into the original object again.

The reverse process is unserialization. 

In PHP, there are different ways to implement serialization. The native way is to rely on the serialize() and unserialize(), which, in turn, rely on the __serialize() and __unserialize() magic method. Then, var_export() and require() make another serialization method. WDDX, XML, JSON or YAML all work as serialization, yet they usually are not considered, over speed or performance issues. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class X {
       private const X = 1;
       
       function foo() {
           // same as \X::C;
           return self::C;

.. _session:

Session
-------

Session support in PHP consists of a way to preserve certain data across subsequent accesses.

It relies on the ``session_*`` functions, and the ``$_SESSION`` superglobal variable.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   if (isset($_SESSION['x'])) {
       print x was already set with the value.$_SESSION['x'];
   }
   
   $_SESSION['x'] = rand(0, 10);

.. _shallow-clone:

Shallow clone
-------------

A shallow clone is an object cloning, where the cloned object keeps the same object properties as the original object. This is a fast way to share data between objects.

Shallow cloning is the default behavior in PHP.

   <?php
   
   class Dog {
       private $name = '';
       private Address $address;
   
       function __construct(string $name, Address $address) {

.. _short-assignation:
.. _combined-operator:

Short assignations
------------------

In addition to the basic assignment operator, there are combined operators for all of the binary arithmetic, array union and string operators that allow you to use a value in an expression and then set its value to the result of that expression.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // incrementing $a by one
   $a = $a + 1;
   
   // short assignement for the above syntax

.. _short-syntax:

Short Syntax
------------

A short syntax is the fusion of an operator with the `=` operator. That way, the operator is applied to the right hand operand, and the left variable, then, assigned to that variable. 

It is convenient when the variable has to be assigned again to itself.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $a = 0;
   // Adds 2 to $a
   $a = $a + 2;
   
   // short syntax to add 3 to $a
   $a += 3;

.. _short-tag:

Short Tags
----------

PHP uses special tags to identify code that has to be executed. The short tags are a special set of PHP tag, shorter than the usual ``<?php``. It was simply ``<?``.

Short tags may be disabled in PHP configuration, with the ``short_open_tag`` directive. 

Short tags are different from echo tags : those tags immediately display data.

From the manual : As short tags can be disabled it is recommended to only use the normal tags (<?php ?> and <?= ?>) to maximise compatibility. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   echo 1;
   ?>
   
   <? 
   // this is a short tag

.. _shutdown-function:
.. _shutdown-handler:

Shutdown Function
-----------------

The shutdown function is a PHP custom function which is called when the application is shutting down. This is after a call to exit(), die() or the natural end of life of the script.

Multiple functions may be registered with the register_shutdown_function() function. They will be called in order of registration.

Shutdown function acts as destructors : they should clean up any unfinished jobs, and gracefully free resources, such as closing files with their correct endings, or gracefully closing connexions.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   // extract from the PHP manual
   function shutdown()
   {
       // This is our shutdown function, in 
       // here we can do any last operations
       // before the script is complete.

.. _signature:

signature
---------

The signature of a method or a function is the list of arguments and constraints that applies when calling it.

.. _single-quote:

Single Quotes Strings
---------------------

Single quoted strings are strings that include a literal value. 

This is an simpler version of the double-quoted strings. 

It is possible to include variables `$var`, single-dimension arrays `$array[1]` or `$array[index]`, and single-dereferencing object members `$object->member`. More complex expressions require usage of curly braces `{$}`, or the usage of the dot operator.

Double quoted strings use the anti-slash `\` to escape special characters, such as the anti-slash and the `$` sign.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // single quoted string : all literal values
   $name = 'elephpant loves $signs.';

.. _singleton:

Singleton
---------

A singleton is a class which can only have one object. There is no way to instantiate the class and get a second, distinct object.

A singleton is used when there is a significant cost or limitations at maintaining multiple instances of the same object. For example, multiple Sqlite3 access to the same file, even as read-only, means several copies of the same file in memory. Or, several object referencing the same lock may be a problem.

Singleton are more difficult to test, as there is only one instance, and it is difficult to control it. Singleton may be achieve by dependency injection, with the same object. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
   // One method to build a singleton class
   class Singleton {
     private static self $instance = null;
     
     // The constructor is private, to avoid multiple instantiation
     // it is still accessible indirectly, via a public static method. 
     private function __construct()
     {
       // the usual constructo code
     }
   
     // the factory to build the singleton 
     public static function getInstance() : self {
       if (self::$instance === null) {
         self::$instance = new self;

.. _solid:

SOLID
-----

SOLID is an acronym for a set of OOP design principle. They were coined by Robert C. Martin (also known as Uncle Bob).

+ S : Single Responsiblity Principle
+ O : Open Closed Principle
+ L : Liskov Substitution Principle
+ I : Interface Segregation Principle
+ D : Dependency Inversion Principle

Each principle may be used independently. Those principle are not dedicated to PHP, though they may be used in PHP.

.. _sort:
.. _sorting:

Sort
----

Sorting is the action to put a list of object into a specific order. In PHP, sorting applies to arrays.

There are several ways to sort arrays in PHP: by value (no prefix), by key (`k` prefix), or by value while keeping the keys (`a` prefix, for associative). 

Then, the sort may be ascending (no prefix), descending (`r`, as in reverse) or custom (`u`, as in user sort). Custom sort is done with a closure or similar.

Based on the prefixes above, the following PHP native functions are available : sort(), rsort(), usort(), ksort(), krsort(), uksort(), asort(), uasort(). There is not ursort(), as the reverse part of the sort may be coded in the custom closure.

In case of ex-aequos while sorting, which are values with the same order, the values are sorted in the same order than the original array. This behavior has changed in PHP 7.0.

It is also possible to sort using a natural sort, which is a way to sort strings like a human would read them : natsort().

The default comparison between elements may be adapted with sort()'s parameter : regular, numeric, string, locale, natural and with or without case.  



.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
   
   $fruits = array( "Orange1", "orange2", "Orange3", "orange20" );
   sort($fruits, SORT_NATURAL | SORT_FLAG_CASE);
   foreach ($fruits as $key => $val) {
       echo "fruits[" . $key . "] = " . $val . "\n";
   }
   
   ?>

.. _spaeceship:

Spaceship operator
------------------

Spaceship operator is an operator which reports if a value is larger, equal or smaller than another value. It return 1, 0 or -1 in each case, respectively. 

The spaceship operator may be replace by a `-` (minus) sign, if the compared values are correct. It may also be replace with `!=`, since -1 and 1 are both cast to `true`. 

The spaceship operator got its name from its resemblance to an flying saucer. Battleship operator, or death star operator do not exist.

Special Typehints
-----------------

PHP defines some special typehints.

+ mixed : any type
+ void : no returned value
+ callable : may be used as a callback
+ iterable : may be used with foreach(), including array
+ never : never returns
+ object : object of any class
+ parent : any of the parent class of the current class, excluding it
+ self : the current class
+ static : the current called class

Other special types are the scalar types.

   function foo(iterable $i) : never {
       foreach ($i as $j) {
           echo $j;

.. _sql-injection:

SQL injection
-------------

A SQL injection is a vulnerability, where external data are used to change the behavior of a SQL query. 

In the example below, `$_GET` are directly used inside the query. By using a clever string (shown in comment), it is possible to bypass the whole condition and get access to any user. 

Among the solutions to mitigate this problem : filter adequately the incoming data; use prepared statements. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
   
   // $_GET['name'] = '" OR 1 = 1 OR "';
   $SQL_query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name=\"".$_GET['name']."\" AND password=\\.$_GET['pass']."\\;
   
   $connexion->query($SQL_query);

.. _view-sql:

SQL Views
---------

Views in a SQL server is a virtual table, build as the result of a SQL query.

Instead of accessing a concrete table, a view is built as a SELECT query, and display the result of that query. As a SELECT, it may join with multiple tables, display columns, build dynamic values, and drop others.

SQL views are usally non-writable (no UPDATE, no INSERT), as they do not mirror a real table.

Sqlite3
-------

SQLite is a C-language library that implements a small, fast, self-contained, high-reliability, full-featured, SQL database engine.

The related extension is Sqlite3. It allows the creation and usage of file-based or memory-based databases.

Sqlite3 is also available with PDO (Portable Document File), with the pdo_sqlite engine.

SSL
---

SSL, the Secure Sockets Layer, is a cryptographic protocol designed to provide communications security over a computer network and on the Web. SSL is often related to HTTPS, for secured transmission with the HTTP protocol, although HTTPS has moved from SSL to TLS.

SSL is a PHP context for sockets, and share the configuration options with TLS.

.. _spl:

Standard PHP Library (SPL)
--------------------------

The Standard PHP Library (SPL) is a collection of interfaces and classes that are meant to solve common problems.

SPL offers features, functions, classes and interfaces in many different fields : iterators, data structures, files, exceptions, and observers. 

One of the most famous SPL features is the function spl_autoload_register(), which register an autoload handler.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // SPL and autoloading
   spl_autoload_register(function ($class) {
       include 'classes/' . $class . '.class.php';
   });
   
   if ($object instanceof Countable) {
       $count = count($object);
   } elseif ($object instanceof Traversable)
       $count = iterator_count($object);

Statement
---------

A statement can be an assignment, a function call, a loop, a conditional statement or even a statement that does nothing (an empty statement). 

Statements usually end with a semicolon. 

In addition, statements can be grouped into a statement-group by encapsulating a group of statements with curly braces. A statement-group is a statement by itself as well.

.. _static:

static
------

Static has many distinct usages.

Static is one of the three special keywords that are used to access properties or methods from inside the class definition. It relates to the current called class.

Static is a keyword for methods and properties : they are turned into class elements, and should be reached with the :: syntax, instead of -> or ?->.

Static is a keyword for closures and arrow functions : it prevents the current scope to be included in with the closure, thus limiting the number of accessible values.

Static is a keyword for variables : those variables aren't removed at the end of the method execution and are available at the beginning of the next call.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class X {
       private const X = 1;
       
       function foo() {
           return static::1;
   
           // same as \X::C; when the object is of class X
           // same as \Y::C; when the object is of class W
       }
   }
   
   class Y extends X {
       private const X = 2;
   }

Static Method
-------------

Static methods are methods defined with the static keyword. They have to be called with the name of the class, rather than instantiated object. 

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class x {
       static function foo() {
           echo __METHOD__;

   <?php
   
   class x {
       static $p = 1;

.. _stdclass:

stdclass
--------

Stdclass is a native PHP class. It is the class used when a generic object is created, for example with json_decode() or the (object) cast operator.

The stdClass is allowed to create dynamic properties on the fly, as its base definition has none. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class X {
       private $property = 1;
       
       function foo() {
           // dynamic property

A storage system is a generic term to describe an external service that store data for a longer time than the current PHP request. 

Storage systems may be RDBMS (SQL servers), key-value stores, noSQL server, file system, memory caching system, etc.


Related : :ref:`RDBMS <rdbms>`, :ref:`Key-value stores <key-value-store>`

.. _stream:

Stream
------

Streams are a generalisation of the notion of files. Just like files, they can be opened, read, written and closed. 

Unlike files, they may be a lot of things : archive, compressed data, sockets, other programs, etc. They also may not support all the range of features of files.

PHP offers native functions to create, configure, filter streams and process their data.

Streams may be extended with the notion of wrapper and protocols.



.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
   
   if ($stream = fopen('https://www.php.net', 'r')) {
       // print the first 100 chars of the HTML page.

.. _strict-comparison:

Strict Comparison
-----------------

Strict comparison is a comparison operator or a control structure that checks not only the value but also the type of the value. In other words, it does not apply any type-juggling to the values before processing. 

Here are the strict operators : ``==`` may be replaced with ``===``,  ``!=`` may be replaced with ``!==``, ``switch`` may be replaced with ``match``, in_array() with the third parameter ``strict`` set to true. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   //true
   var_dump(1 == 1);
   //false
   var_dump(1 === 1);
   
   //true
   var_dump(null == 0);
   //false

strict_types
------------

strict_types is an execution directive, that makes PHP more strict when applying the typehints. In particular, it doesn't cast values automatically, but raise an error. 

``strict_types`` is an option per file, and is set with the declare() function.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   declare(strict_types=1);
   
   function foo(int $a) {}
   
   foo(1);
   foo(1.3);

String
------

A string is series of characters, where a character is the same as a byte. This means that PHP only supports a 256-character set, and hence does not offer native Unicode support.

.. _string-interpolation:

String Interpolation
--------------------

String interpolation is a feature where variables inside a string are dynamically replaced by their value at execution time. 

There are several ways to do interpolation : 

+ use double-quotes and a variable
+ use double-quotes and a property or a array with a valid index
+ use curly braces with a variable
+ use dollar and curly-braces : it calls the variable whose name is dynamically calculated in the curly braces. This syntax is deprecated in PHP 8.2 and later.

Double quotes and Heredoc notation allows string interpolation. On the other hand, single quote and nowdoc forbid interpolation. Then, escaping the special characters such as `$` and `{` with `\\` also disables interpolation locally.

Interpolation happens inside strings, while concatenation happens between strings.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $world = 'world';
   // This is an interpolated string
   $string = Hello $world;
   
   // This is not an interpolated string
   $string = 'Hollow $world';

.. _stringable:

Stringable
----------

Stringable is a type, which represents variables that may be used as as string : either a string, a heredoc or a string constant; or an object which has the `__toString()` method.

Stringable is automatically added to any class (and subclass) that has the `__toString()` method, though it is recommended to add it explicitely.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   function foo(stringable $s) {
   	print $s;

Added in PHP 8.0

.. _strpos-syndrom:

Strpos() syndrom
----------------

The strpos() syndrom is a classic bug : strpos() searches for a string inside another string. It reports its index upon finding it, or false, if the string was not found.

PHP's string are indexed starting with 0, so the found string might be in an index from 0 to the size of the string. 

PHP also cast 0 to false. And false is also the value that is returned when the string is not found. So, if the found string is at the very beginning of the searched string, it might be confused for its absence.

To avoid confusion, it is recommended to make an explicit comparison with false, using `===` or `!==`.

Note that many PHP native functions behave that way, and should be treated with the same precaution.

In the case of strpos(), it may be replaced with str_contains() (since PHP 8.0) or a regex, to get safer results.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $haystack = 'abcdef';
   
   if (strpos($haystack, 'b')) {
   	print "The haystack contains a 'b'\n";
   }
   
   if (strpos($haystack, 'a')) {
   	print "The haystack contains an 'a'\n";
   } else {
   	print "The haystack doesn't contain an 'a'\n";
   }

Supply Chain Attack
-------------------

Supply Chain Attack is a security attack that uses dependencies to infect a program.

Modern applications are built on top of components which are fetched from central repositories. In the PHP world, composer is the most popular PHP repository.

When those external repositories are infected with malicious component or code, the dependency manager loads them like the rest of the code. Blind trust in the imported code lead to vulnerabilities.

.. _switch-case:

Switch Case
-----------

A switch case, also called case, is an option in a switch() or a match() expression. 

In a switch(), several cases may be used in a row, to apply the same code. This is not possible with match().

In a switch(), the case's code is executed until the end of the switch(), or a break command. A case that uses its own code, and the following case's code is called a fallthrough. 

There is a default case, which is called when all other cases fail.

In the event of multiple identical cases, the first one is used. PHP adapts the type of the values while looking for the right case.


.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
   
   switch($x) {
   	case 'a':
   	case 'c':

A fallthrough is the absence of break (or equivalent) at the end of a switch case. That way, the execution continues on the next case. 

While this is an intended feature, and is useful to reduce code, it tends to surprise programmers, which expect the cases to always end. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   switch ($a) {
       case 1:
           $a = 2 * $a;
           // fallthrough here : the execution continue
           
       case 2:
           $a = $a + 1;
           break;
   }

.. _system-call:

System Call
-----------

A system call is a call to an operating system function. In PHP, those are done with the shell_exec(), system() and exec() functions; and the `` (back tick) operators.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // list files
   $list = shell_exec('ls -1');
   
   ?>

.. _template:

Template
--------

A template is a preset document, filled with values in placeholders, to display the resulting data. This is also called a view.

PHP used to be known as a template engine. Nowadays, template engines are written in PHP. 

Templates may be produced in any file format : HTML, CSS, Javascript, JSON, PDF, URL, etc. 

Template may be large : they are then broken down into smaller and reusable sub-templates.

Some template packages : Twig, Latte, Blade, smarty.

.. _test:

Test
----

Tests are tools that monitor the behavior of a code. The code should produce the expected results that are provided in the tests.

There are many different types of tests : 

+ Unit test : close to the class level of the code
+ Integration test : they check that components collaborate nicely
+ Functional tests : close to the specifications and the business level
+ End-to-end tests : they run the software from beginning to the end
+ Performance tests : tests focusing on the behavior of the software under load
+ Acceptance tests : the tests that the sofware must pass to be accepted by the end user
+ Smoke tests : tests that quickly detect a problem in the software. They are the most obvious. 
+ Exploratory tests : when tests are used to check new behavior of the code
+ Regression tests : tests that ensures that previous behaviors are still behaving the same
+ Fuzzing : testing the sofware with random data

Tests may be manual, when they are executed manually. Those are not recorded. Test may be automated, when they are executed by another piece of software. 

PHP has several testing framework : PHPunit, pest, pint, simpletest, atoum.

Tests are often further automated in a Continuous Integration Pipeline.

.. _traversal:

Traversal
---------

A traversal is the list of all elements in a data structure. 

foreach() is a command to do a traversal on an array or an iterable object. 

Traversal may be recursive : for example, the recursive iterators in the SPL library features the `RecursiveArrayIterator` class, which traverses multi-dimensional arrays.

Traversal of a tree or graph datastructure turns the graph into a array-like list.



.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
   
   $array = range(0, 9);
   
   foreach($array as $item) {
   	print $item\n;
   	// list digits from 0 to 9
   }
   
   // adds 10, 11, 12 to the previous array
   // in a separate 
   $array[] = [10, 11, 12];
   
   $iterator = new RecursiveArrayIterator($array);

Type Juggling
-------------

Type juggling is the emblematic PHP feature, where data has no specific type definition, and its type may change depending on the situation.

For example, integers are translated into string when displayed, or kept as integers to be used with math operations. 

Type juggling is usually done automatically, without user intervention. Explicit type juggling is achieved with the cast operators.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $a = 35;
   echo $a + 4; // display 39

.. _uri:

Universal Resource Identifier (URI)
-----------------------------------

Universal Resource Identifier is a unique sequence of characters that identifies a logical or physical resource used by web technologies.

URI are strings, with a special format, also called scheme, which allows identify uniquely a resource, without providing its location. 

For example, a ISBN is a unique universal identifier for a book, yet it doesn't mention where to find such book. 

URI is closely related to URL, which provides the location of the desired resource.

Related : :ref:`Universal Resource Locator (URL) <url>`

.. _url:

Universal Resource Locator (URL)
--------------------------------

Universal Resource Locator is a string that represents a resource, where to find it, how to access it. 

The full URL include the following information : 

+ protocol : for example, http, https, mongodb, zip
+ user : the username for authentication purposes
+ pass : the password associated with the username
+ server : the name or the address of the server where the resource reside
+ path : the location of the resource on the server
+ query : extra parameters to reach the resource
+ fragment : the location of the resource inside the previous address (server + path)

PHP has several functions dedicated to processing URL, such as parse_url() and http_build_query(). 

PHP also makes use of URL as a generalisation for file path. For example, file_get_contents() and fopen() both work on local and remote files, via URL.

PHP is able to process different protocols with its internal Protocols and Wrappers, using the file system functions.



.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
   
   print_r(parse_url('https://www.php.net/'));
   
   /*
   Array
   (
       [scheme] => https
       [host] => www.php.net

.. _unserialization:
.. _unserialize:

Unsserialization
----------------

Unserialization is the extraction of an object from a string representation of an object.

The reverse process is serialization. 

In PHP, there are different ways to implement serialization. The native way is to rely on the serialize() and unserialize(), which, in turn, rely on the __serialize() and __unserialize() magic method. Then, var_export() and require() make another serialization method. WDDX, XML, JSON or YAML all work as serialization, yet they usually are not considered, over speed or performance issues. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class X {
       private const X = 1;

Unused
------

Unused is a state of a PHP structure. It has been declared, defined or created, but it is used. This is characteristics of dead code.

Being unused happens to constants, variables, parameters, properties, methods, classes, traits, interfaces, use expression. 

It also happens to propagate : removing an unused function may actually create another unused function, which was only called by the first one. 


.. code-block:: php

.. _use:

Use
---

The use operator has three distinct usage. 

The use operator allows the import and aliasing of fully qualified names (such as classes, interfaces, constants, ...)  in the current namespace. 

When `use` used inside a class or a trait, it imports a trait and its methods and properties. 

When `use` is used with a closure, it imports the listed variables in the closure, from the defining environment. 

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   namespace \My\Space {
       // class importation with use
       use \Some\Other\Space\aClass as A;

Use Alias
---------

The use operator can create aliases for a class, function or constant. After the declaration of the alias, it is possible to use the original class with the alias name.

.. _uuid:

UUID
----

UUID is a universally unique identifier. It is an identifier that anyone can generate, and that has a near certainty that it identify something unique in the universe. 

UUID are in constrast to classic integer ids, such as auto-increment primary keys, which usually start at 0, and are incrementally generated. Not only this means connecting to a database, and querying the right table, but also means that there are multiple usage of 1, in each of these tables.

UUID are a standard. The standard has versions from 1 to 5, each with improvements.

.. _variable-argument:

Variable Arguments
------------------

Variable arguments refers to a methodcall where the list of argument is depends on the call, rather than the signature of the method.

Variable arguments are achieved with the variadic operator, or with the func_get_args() functions. Variadic operator covers most of the cases, and func_get_args() covers the remaining edge cases. 

Variable arguments may be static or dynamic. It is static when the list of arguments varies from call to call, and are hard-coded. Dynamic argument list depends on variadic operator, or call_user_func_array() functions.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // No arguments in the signature.
   function foo() {
   	// displays the list of arguments
   	print_r(func_get_args());
   }
   
   // static arguments
   foo(1, 2);
   foo(4, 5, 6);
   
   // dynamic variable arguments
   $args = range(5, rand(9, 11)) ; 
   foo(...$args);

Variable Scope
--------------

Variable scope is the context in which the variable is available. The context is often one method or function. 

``global`` keywords allows variables from other contextes to be available in the current one. 

Local variables are only available in one method or function, not counting the local or bind closures or arrow functions. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   function foo() {
   	// $a is only available in foo
   	$a = 1;
   }
   
   function bar() {
   	// $a is only available in bar, and is distinct from the one in foo()
   	$a = 2;
   
   	// $bar is only available in bar, the followring closure and the arrow function
   	$b = 1;

.. _variable_order:

variable_order
--------------

The `variable_order` directive sets the order in which the values are aassigned to the `$_REQUEST` variable.

The default is `EGPCS` : Environment, GET, POST, COOKIE and SESSION. The values are overwritten by the next, so if GET and POST have both an `x` variable, the default configuration will only keep the one from POST, as it is later in the configuration. 

The default configuration ensures that safer values, such as the session's value, are not overwritten by less safe values from GET or POST, for example.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // variable_order = EGPCS
   // https://www.example.com/index.php?x=1
   // POST x = 2;

   <?php
   
   $array = [1, 2, 3];
   
   // same as foo(0, 1,2, 3);

.. _wrapper:

Wrapper
-------

A Wrapper is a custom way to access remote resources. It is designed to look like accessing to file, on the file system, but using other drivers than the ones of the hard drive. It is based on a configuration string, which looks like a URL : `ftp://www.site.com/file.txt`, where the part before the `://` is the protocol.

Among the predefined PHP wrapper, there are http://, ftp://, zlib://, phar://, rar://, expect://. 

A wrapper is also a design pattern, also called an adapter. This concept also appears when a component provide access to a remote service : it is a PHP wrapper (wrapper for the service when calling PHP) or a `service-name` wrapper, when it is viewed from PHP.
