.. _$_files:

$_FILES
-------

An associative array of items uploaded to the current script via the HTTP POST method.

+ ``$_FILES['userfile']['name']`` : the original name of the file on the client machine.
+ ``$_FILES['userfile']['type']`` : the mime type of the file, if the browser provided this information. An example would be image/gif. This mime type is however not checked on the PHP side and therefore don't take its value for granted.
+ ``$_FILES['userfile']['size']`` : the size, in bytes, of the uploaded file.
+ ``$_FILES['userfile']['tmp_name']`` : the temporary filename of the file in which the uploaded file was stored on the server.
+ ``$_FILES['userfile']['error']`` : the error code associated with this file upload.
+ ``$_FILES['userfile']['full_path']`` : the full path as submitted by the browser. This value does not always contain a real directory structure, and cannot be trusted. Available as of PHP 8.1.0.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
       // $a->file was filled with $_FILES at some point
       move_uploaded_file($a->file['tmp_name'], $target);
   
   ?>

.. _this:

$this
-----

Methods are function dedicated to a class. They are defined inside the body of a class, and may only be access in relation to that class : via an object, the class name or another method. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class x {
       public function foo() {
           echo "I am foo!\n";
       }
   }
   
   $x = new Y();
   $y->foo(); // calling the foo method, defined in x,
   
   ?>

.. _-__clone:

__clone
-------

To clone an object is the creation of a new distinct object, from an existing one. This is basically a copy, although the object itself is multiplied by call the clone operator.

By default PHP does a shallow clone, duplicating the scalars (string, integer...) and keeping the same link to objet objects. To make a deep clone, the class must define the ``__clone`` magic method.

Cloning is similar to creating another object of the same class, without requiring all the constructor arguments.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $spike = new Dog('Spike', 'Teckel', 'red');
   $medor = clone $spike;
   
   $medor->setCollar('green'); // distinguish spike and medor by collar
   
   ?>

.. _abstract:

Abstract Keyword
----------------

PHP has abstract classes and methods. Classes defined as abstract cannot be instantiated, and any class that contains at least one abstract method must also be abstract.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   abstract class AbstractClass
   {
       // Force Extending class to define this method
       abstract protected function getValue();
       abstract protected function prefixValue($prefix);
   
       // Common method
       public function printOut() {
           print $this->getValue() . \n;
       }
   }
   
   ?>

.. _ast:

Abstract Syntactic Tree
-----------------------

An abstract syntax tree (AST), is a tree representation of the abstract syntactic structure of PHP source code. 

`Documentation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree>`__

.. _addition:

Addition
--------

PHP additions apply to two different types : numbers and arrays.

For numbers, a.k.a. integers or float, this is the classic mathematical addition. 

For arrays, this is a special version of array merge : the arrays are merged, and keys are kept once they are written. This features only exists for addition and arrays. Substraction is not available. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $a = 1 + 2.3; // 3.3
   
   $b = [1] + [3, 4]; // [1, 4]
   
   ?>

.. _namespace-alias:

Alias
-----

 PHP can alias(/import) constants, functions, classes, interfaces, and namespaces. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   namespace a {
       class x {
       }
   }
   
   namespace b {
       use a\x as aX;
   }
   
   ?>

.. _alternative-syntax:

Alternative Syntax
------------------

PHP offers an alternative syntax for some of its control structures; namely, if, while, for, foreach, and switch. In each case, the basic form of the alternate syntax is to change the opening brace to a colon (:) and the closing brace to endif;, endwhile;, endfor;, endforeach;, or endswitch;, respectively.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php if ($a == 5): ?>
   A is equal to 5
   <?php endif; ?>
   


`Documentation <https://www.php.net/manual/en/control-structures.alternative-syntax.php>`__

Related : :ref:`control-structure<control-structure>`

.. _anonymous-class:

Anonymous Class
---------------

A class may be instantiate, without defining a class name. The class is identical to a named-class, except for the name attribute. This also means that it cannot be used for typehinting, though it may be typed itself, using parent class or implemented interfaces. 

Also, arguments may be passed at instantiation time, unlink with named-class definition, where those arguments are passed when calling ``new``, not when defining the class.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   interface i {}
   function foo(i $a) {}
   
   $a = new class () implements i {};
   
   foo($a);
   
   
   ?>

.. _arbitrary-argument:

Arbitrary Number of Argument
----------------------------

PHP allows any number of arguments to be passed to a functioncall. In the function definition, receiving those arguments means managing an arbitrary number of parameters. 

This is achieved with the variadic operator, or with functions such as func_get_args().

They are also called variable argument lists.

When the arguments are dynamic, aka they are collected at execution time, the operator variadic or the function call_user_func_array() turns an array to arguments.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   function foo(...$args) {
       print This function is called with.count($args).arguments\n;
       print This function is called with.func_get_count().arguments\n;
       print This function is called with.count($func_get_args()).arguments\n;
   } 
   
   $array = range(0, rand(5, 10)); // generates an array with 1 to 11 elements
   
   foo(...$array);
   call_user_func_array('foo', $array));
   
   ?>

.. _argument:

Argument
--------

Arguments are values passed to a function or method, at execution time. They may be a variable or an expression.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   function foo($parameter) {}
   
   $argument = 1;
   foo($argument + 2);
   
   ?>

.. _argumentcounterror:

ArgumentCountError
------------------

ArgumentCountError is thrown when too few arguments are passed to a user-defined function or method. This is an error, not an exception.

No exception is raised for extra parameters, as those may still be processed by the method itself. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   function foo($a) {}
   
   // No error is raised here
   foo(1,2);
   
   // ArgumentCountError is catchable
   try {
       foo();
   } catch (ArgumentCountError) {
       print 'No enough parameters passed.';
   }
   ?>

.. _arithmeticerror:

ArithmeticError Error
---------------------

``ArithmeticError`` is thrown when an error occurs while performing mathematical operations. These errors include attempting to perform a bitshift by a negative amount, and any call to intdiv() that would result in a value outside the possible bounds of an int. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // ArithmeticError is catchable
   try {
       8 >> -1;
   } catch (ArgumentCountError) {
       print 'Cannot do a negative shift';
   }
   ?>

.. _array:

Array
-----

array is the array structure in PHP. 

It may be written as array() or with square brackets `[]`.

An array assigns automatically an integer index to the values appended to it. An arbitrary index may be assigned with the => syntax, or when accessing an element in the array. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $array = array(1, 2, 3); 
   
   $anotherArray = ['a' => 2, 'b' => 33];
   
   echo $anotherArray['b']; // 33
   
   ?>

Added in PHP 4.0

.. _array-spread:

Array spread
------------

Array spread is the ellipsis operator, applied to an array. Then, the array itself is replaced by each of its own element, as if each element was spread from the array.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $a = [1,2,3];
   $b = [...$a, 4,5];
   
   // $b === [1,2,3,4,5];

.. _array-curly-braces:

Array With Curly Braces
-----------------------

Specifying an array index with the curly braces, instead of the square brackets.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $a = array(0, 1, 2, 3);
   echo $a{2};
   
   ?>

Added in PHP 8.0

.. _arrays:

Arrays
------

An array in PHP is actually an ordered map. A map is a type that associates values to keys.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $array = array('a' => 1, 'b' => 2, 'c' => 3, 4, []);
   
   ?>

.. _arrow-function:

Arrow Functions
---------------

Arrow functions are a type of closure with a specific syntax. It only accepts one expression, and uses the local context of definition.

   <?php
   
   $b = 10;
   $fn = fn($a) => $a + $b + 2;

.. _assertion:

Assertions
----------

Assertions are checks that take effect in development and testing environments, but are optimised away to have zero cost in production. 

Assertions are disabled in production, by using the `zend.assertions` directive. Then, they are said 'zero-cost' : they are completely removed from the code, and not executed.

Assertions are a development tool, and should not be used. Be aware that the removal of the assertion may leave the system running with unchecked data. 

There are user-land assertions, such as `webmozart/assert <https://packagist.org/packages/webmozart/assert>`_ and `beberlei/assert <https://packagist.org/packages/beberlei/assert>`_.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php

.. _assignation:

Assignations
------------

The basic assignment operator is `=`. Your first inclination might be to think of this as `equal to`. Don't. It really means that the left operand gets set to the value of the expression on the right (that is, "gets set to").

.. _variable-blind:

Blind Variable
--------------

Blind variables are variables dedicated to a loop. They have a local use, within this loop and rarely after that. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   foreach($array as $blind => $blindToo) {
       doSomething($blind, $blindToo);

.. _boolean:

Boolean
-------

A boolean is a value that is either true or false. 

PHP's boolean are constants. They may be prefixed by `\\`, and are case-insensitive. They can't be redefined in namespaces.

There are rules to convert any data to a boolean. 

Booleans have a related scalar typehint : `bool`. There is also a special `false` typehint.

   <?php
   
   $a = True;
   $b = \FALSE;
   
   ?>

.. _break:

Break
-----

Break is a control structure, which ends execution of the current for, foreach, while, do-while or switch structure.

break accepts an optional argument, which tells how many enclosing structures are to be broken out of. 

break should not be confused with `continue` : continue doesn't work in a switch, like a break does.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   foreach([1,2,3] as $b) {
       // break upon the first even number
       if ($b % 2 == 0) {

---------

Callables are objects that can pass the callable typehint. 

Callable may be callabacks, closures or arrow functions. 

Classes may also be callable, when they implement the magic method `__invoke`.

.. _callback:

Callback
--------

Callback are functions which are used as parameters for other functions. Such functions are used to customize the main function. For example, array_map(), which applies a callback to every element of an array, or usort(), which sorts an array using a function.

Callback is akin to a functioncall : it is actually hidden inside the caller function. 

Callback may be build with on closures, arrow-functions, native PHP functions, methods and static methods. They also use string (i.e., `'strtolower'`) and array (i.e. `[X::class, 'methodName']`, or `[$object, 'methodName']` ) syntax. In fact, anything that is_callable() may be used. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $array = ['Damien', 'Dan', 'Daniel', 'Davey', 'David', 'Dennis', 'Derick', 'Dmitry', 'Dustin',];
   $array = array_map('strtolower', $array);
   
   //['damien', 'dan', 'daniel', 'davey', 'david', 'dennis', 'derick', 'dmitry', 'dustin',];

(bool), (boolean) - cast to boolean
(float), (double), (real) - cast to float
(string) - cast to string
(array) - cast to array
(object) - cast to object

.. _clone:

clone
-----

Clone makes a duplicate of an object.

PHP makes a shallow clone : it will only make a copy of the scalars properties, and it will keep the reference to any object untouched. This means that objects are shared between an object and its clone. 

To perform a deep clone, aka to clone an object and its referenced properties, there is the magic method __clone().



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class x { }
   
   // instantiation
   $x = new x;

.. _compact-array:

Compact array
-------------

An array is compact if it only uses automated indices, starting with 0. This doesn't really show in PHP code, though performances are better for some operations.

Such array's status may be reached by using array_values() or array_keys() on the array. 

This notion is not related to the compact() function.

   <?php
   
   $array = [1,2,3];

Concatenation
-------------

Concatenation is the PHP feature that appends two strings together, to make a third, longer one.

Concatenation is also achieved with interpolation, inside a string; by calling echo, multiple times or with multiple arguments; by using the join() function.

Concatenation is done with the dot operator.

.. _conditioned:

Conditioned Structures
----------------------

Conditioned structures are definitions that are placed inside a condition structure. 

For example, it is possible to create a function or a class, only if it doesn't exist. 

classes, traits, interfaces, global constants (with define()), enumerations, functions may be conditioned. 

class constants, properties, methods and cases (for enum) cannot be conditioned.

Conditioned structures adapt the PHP context to external condition. For example, some function may become native after a specific PHP version, and is only redefined for older installation. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   if (!function_exists('foo')) {
       function foo() {
           // doSomething
       }
   }
   
   Some structures do not accept condition, such as global constants with `const` keyword (with define() function, it is OK).
   
   ?>

.. _const:

Const
-----

const is a PHP keyword, that introduces constant definitions. 

const is allowed inside classes and traits, to create class constants. const is also allowed in the global scope, to create global constants. 

const is only allowed in the body of a trait and a class, and the first level of a main file. It is not possible to create conditioned constants with a if-then structure and const : this requires an include.

CSV
---

CSV stands for Comma Separated Values. It is a file format, used by many platforms to store and read data. 

PHP has several dedicated native functions to read and write from those files : fputcsv() and fgetcsv().


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // Example from the PHP documentation
   $list = array (
      array('aaa', 'bbb', 'ccc', 'dddd'),
      array('123', '456', '789'),
      array('aaa', 'bbb')

---------

declare() construct is used to set execution directives for a block of code. 

declare() may set the following values : 

+ strict_type : strict typing in the block
+ ticks : generate a tick event 
+ encoding : per-file encoding directive


.. code-block:: php

.. _deep-clone:

Deep clone
----------

A deep clone is an object cloning, where the cloned object also clone its own object properties. This prevents the original object to share data with the cloned one, yet it is slower to process.

Deep cloning is achieved by using the ``__clone`` magic method. By default, PHP does shallow clone.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class Dog {
       private $name = '';
       private Address $address;
   
       function __construct(string $name, Address $address) {
           $this->address->setName($address);
       }
       
       function moves(string $address) {
           $this->address->setName($address);
       }
   
       function __clone() {
           $this->address = clone $this->address;
       }
   }
   
   $spike = new Dog('Spike', new Address('Acme city'));
   $medor = clone $spike;
   $medor->moves('Upstate farm');
   
   // spike and medor do now share the same address

.. _default:

Default Keyword
---------------

default is a PHP keyword, used with switch() and match() structures. It represents any case that was not already considered.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   switch ($i) {
       case 0:
           echo i equals 0;
           break;
       case 1:
           echo i equals 1;
           break;
       default 2:
           echo i is not 0 nor 1;
           break;
   }
   
   ?>

.. _default-parameter:

Default Parameter
-----------------

Functions may define a default value for parameters. That way the parameter may be omitted during the call, and this value will be used. 

The default value may be a static expression, and, since PHP 8.1, also include new expression. 

The default parameter must be the last of the parameters : adding a parameter without default value after one will yield an error and mess up the call parameters.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   function makeCodffe($type = 'latte') {
       return Making a cup of $latte;
   }
   
   ?>

.. _default-value:

Default Value
-------------

Default value is the value that a variable or a property takes when it is used for the first time, and have not been provided.

Arguments and properties may have a default value. That way, arguments may be skipped when the method is being called, and the properties do not have to be initialized before usage.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   function foo($a = 1) {
       echo $a;
   }
   
   foo('one ');
   foo();

.. _define:

define()
--------

define() is a PHP function, that introduces constant definitions. 

define() is a function, and may be called anywhere. It is slower than `const`, as it is only executed at runtime. define() doesn't allow class constants creation.

define() used to create case-insensitive constant, but this was abandonned in PHP 7.3.



.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
       define('HELLO', 'Hello');
       
       print HELLO . world\n;

See also `Road to dependency injection <https://matthiasnoback.nl/2018/06/road-to-dependency-injection/`_

.. _dereferencing:

Dereferencing
-------------

Dereferencing is the action to access a value, which is reference with a pointer. Since PHP has no pointer, dereferencing applies to accessing an element in an array. 

Dereferencing is also applicable to function calls : when a function returns an array, it is possible to immediately access one of the element by using the array syntax.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $array = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
   
   echo $array['b'];
   
   function foo() {
       return ['x', 'y', 'z'];
   }
   
   foo()[2]; // display z
   
   ?>

.. _destructor:

destructor
----------

The destructor is a special method in a class, which is called at shutdown of an object, in order to do any last minute cleaning. 

Most of the time, the destructor is automatic : removing scalar values may be sufficient. In cases of resources, or other objects, it is recommended to issue the graceful commands to shut them down in turn. 

Destructors are usually called after the end of the script, and will not have access to any display. As such, calls to echo are ineffective.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class X {
       private $file;
   
       function __construct($path) {
           $this->file = fopen($path, 'w');
       }
       
       function __destruct() {
           fwrite($this->file, End);
           fclose($this->file);
       }
   }

Directives
----------

Directives are the configuration option of PHP. They may be set in the php.ini file, in HTTP server files like .htaccess, or accessed via the ini_get() and ini_set() native calls. 

Directives are also set by PHP extension.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   echo 'display_errors = ' . ini_get('display_errors') . \n;
   echo 'register_globals = ' . ini_get('register_globals') . \n;

.. _dynamic-call:

Dynamic Call
------------

A dynamic call happens when part of the syntax comes from a variable, and is not known at code writing time.

In PHP, every syntax may use a dynamic call.



.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
   
   $constant = Name;
   echo constant($constant); 
   echo constant(someClass::$constant); 
   
   $variable = 'a';

.. _dynamic-class:

Dynamic Class
-------------

A dynamic class is a class whose fully qualified name is defined at execution time. 

This is convenient for module systems, where the actual class is named from an external configuration.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class AB {}
   
   class AC {}
   
   $name = '\A'.(rand(0, 1) ? 'B' : 'C');
   
   $object = new $name;
   
   ?>


Related : :ref:`new<new>`

.. _dynamic-constant:

Dynamic Constant
----------------

A constant is dynamic when its name is a piece of data, and is only access at execution time. 

Calling a constant is done by using the constant() function. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   const A = 1;
   
   $a = 'A';
   
   echo constant($a); // displays 1
   
   ?>

.. _dynamic-loading:

Dynamic Loading
---------------

Dynamic Loading is related to the loading of PHP extensions, at execution time. 

Most of the time, the extensions are compiled with PHP, and loaded at startup. For development purposes, or for distribution purposes, some libraries may be loaded at execution time, with the dl() function.

Dl() calls are considered bad for performances and for security. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
       // add extra features to PHP
       dl('ldap.so');
   ?>

.. _dynamic-property:

Dynamic Properties
------------------

Dynamic properties are properties created on the fly, without previous definition. 

When the class implements the magic methods __get() and __set(), of if the class extends stdclass, then no warning is emitted.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class X {
       private $property = 1;
       
       function foo() {

.. _escape-character:

Escape Character
----------------

Escape characters are special characters, that introduce a special meaning, for example when redacting an escape sequence.

Escape characters are often generating a special sequence to escape themselves and allow their literal meaning to be expressed.

In PHP's strings and HEREDOC, the escape character is the backslash : \



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   echo <a href="https://www.exakat.io/" />
   
   ?>


`Documentation <https://www.php.net/manual/en/regexp.reference.escape.php>`__

See also `String literals (MySQL) <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/string-literals.html>`_

.. _escape-sequence:

Escape Sequences
----------------

Escape sequences are sequences of characters with a special meaning. Most of the time, the literal value of the character displayed is its meaning, while, sometimes, there are other hidden meaning.

An escape sequence is dedicated to a technology, and they are rare the same between two technologies, or even, between two engines dedicated to that technology.

Examples of escape sequences ; 

PHP, in strings: 
  + \n (new line)
  + \t (horizontal tabulation)
  + "  (double quote, inside a double quoted-string)
  + "  This is not an escape sequence : single quoted string do not recognize this

HTML : 
 + &acute; (a acute accent)
 + &quote; (double quote)

Escape sequences should not be confused with escape characters, though they are related : some escape sequences are introduced by an escape character. Others rely on a format. 
 


.. code-block:: php

extract()
---------

extract() is a native PHP function, which creates arrays from an array containing variables and their values.

extract() has option to handle situations where the variables are already existing, and how those conflicts should be handled : by default, it overwrites the local variables.

Options are :  ``EXTR_OVERWRITE``, ``EXTR_SKIP``, ``EXTR_PREFIX_SAME``, ``EXTR_PREFIX_ALL``, ``EXTR_PREFIX_INVALID``, ``EXTR_IF_EXISTS``, ``EXTR_PREFIX_IF_EXISTS``, ``EXTR_REFS``.

It is the opposite of compact().

.. _upload:

File Upload
-----------

PHP is able to receive files as part of a form submission. 

PHP is capable of receiving file uploads from any RFC-1867 compliant browser. 

File upload code is based on the $_FILES superglobale, and move_uploaded_file() function. It also relies on several PHP directives :  ``file_uploads``, ``upload_max_filesize``, ``upload_tmp_dir``, ``post_max_size`` and ``max_input_time``. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   $uploaddir = '/var/www/uploads/';
   $uploadfile = $uploaddir . basename($_FILES['userfile']['name']);
   
   echo '<pre>';
   if (move_uploaded_file($_FILES['userfile']['tmp_name'], $uploadfile)) {

.. _heredoc:

Heredocs
--------

Heredoc is a string syntax, similar to nowdoc, with internal variable interpolation. They behave like double quoted strings.

The Heredocs syntax uses an arbitrary delimiter. The same delimiter will mark the end of the string.

Heredocs are convenient for large amount of text, that has to be hardcoded. Smaller string will be better suited with double quotes, while even longer text should be processed with a templating system.

It is possible to indent the text in a nowdocs string: to avoid this indentation to be passed at execution time, the final delimiter may be indented too. Its indentation will be removed from the parsed text.

 

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $heredoc = <<<DELIM
   This is a long text.
   
   $variable will not be replaced, and the text stays intact.
   
   DELIM;
   
   $heredoc = <<<DELIM
       This is an indented text.
       DELIM;

Hexadecimal has native support in PHP with the ``0x123`` format. There is also support for hexadecimal characters, inside double-quote strings, with the ``\xhh`` syntax.

There are functions to convert from and to hexadecimal format : hexdec(), dechex() and base_convert(), from ten to sixteen.

PHP also has special syntax for binary and octal numbers. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
       $twenty    = 0x14;
       $twentyToo = 20;

.. _include:

Inclusion
---------

Inclusion is the process to read an external file, and evaluate with the current application for execution. It may define new structures, and execute code. 

Inclusion relies on four language structures : include, require, include_once, require_once. 

Inclusion is often hidden in autoload() functions : the code is included class per class, upon request. 



.. code-block:: php
   
    vars.php
   <?php
   
   $color = 'green';
   $fruit = 'apple';
   
   ?>
   
   test.php
   <?php
   
   echo A $color $fruit; // A
   
   include 'vars.php';
   
   echo A $color $fruit; // A green apple
   
   ?>

.. _inclusion:

Inclusions
----------

Including a PHP file into another PHP file. This is usually isolated into the autoloading feature.

.. _index:

Index
-----

A index is the identifier of an specific element in an array. They may automatically generated, by simply omitting them at creation time. 

PHP index may be integers or strings only. Other data type will generate an error or a type conversion. For example, floats will be turned into integer. integer-shaped strings will also be turned into integer.

PHP index start at 0. They may be automatically assigned by appending a new value with the `[]` operator : then, they will use the greatest available index + 1.


.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
       $array = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
       
       echo $array[0];

.. _inequality:

Inequality
----------

Inequalities are the mathematical comparison of values, with the `>`,  `>=`,  `<` and `=<` operators. 

Unlike the equality operators, they do not have a strict version, which takes into account the type of the values. Hence, the compared values are always adapted to each other's type.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // displays false
   var_dump(3 > 3);
   
   // displays true

integer
-------

An int is a number of the set ℤ = {..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...}. It is limited by PHP_INT_MIN (lower bound) and PHP_INT_MAX (upper bound). 

Integers have several syntaxes : they may be written in binary, octal, decimal, hexadecimal and with `_` as a separator.

.. _internationalization:

Internationalization
--------------------

Internationalization is the process to make the human interface of a program in a local language. 

PHP includes some internationalization capabilities, via the locale, for dates or money format, or with the ext/intl extension. 

Most of the interface translations for application is done with specific components, such as `Symfony/translation`. Translation of interface messages is part of this concept.

Internationalization is also called `i18n`, aka i, 18 letters and n. This is shorter to write. This word may be written with a z or an s, depending on the flavor of English being used.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   /* Configure le script en hollandais */

.. _language-construct:

Language construct
------------------

PHP has 'language construct', which are special keywords, with an attached feature. 

Language constructs are : echo, require, require_once, include, include_once, return, die, exit, unset, isset, print, empty.

Language constructs usually do not require parenthesis, and they are mostly known for that. The parenthesis is not necessary, but possible. It makes the language construct look like a function call. 

Also, language construct do not behave like a function, so they can't be used by their name, as a callback. 

There have some special behavior : echo accepts an arbitrary number of argument, while print only accepts one. die and exit work without arguments, but, in the event that an argument is provided, it must be enclosed in parenthesis.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   echo 'a', 'b', 'c';

.. _linting:

Linting
-------

Linting is the process to turn the Text file that holds the source code, into tokens. During this first phase, PHP applies some checks, and report anything that makes no sense.

After linting, the code is processed further before reaching the status of opcode, where it can be executed. 

Linting is an option of the PHP CLI : `-l`. 

Linting is sometimes mistaken with 'compiling' : linting is a part of a compilation. Since, it is the only step available in PHP between the code and the execution (with eval() or the PHP CLI), linting is often considered as compiling. 



.. _list:

list
----

List() acts as the contrary to array() : it will break an array into individual elements, and assign them to the arguments of the list. 

List() also has a short array version, which is `[ ]` the square brackets. Those square brackets are only appearing on the left side of an assignation. 

list() may omit extracted values by skipping their value, and leaving seemingly empty arguments. List() also supports double-arrow notation, where the key is provided. 

list() may be nested. It may also be used with foreach() structures.

list() looks like a function, though it only appears on the left part of an assignation, and is actually a language-construct.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   list($a, $b, $c) = [1,2,3];
   
   [$a, , [$c]] = [1,2,[3],4];
   
   [2 => $c, 0 => $a] = [1,2,3,4];
   
   $rows = [[1,2], [3, 4]];
   foreach($rows as [$a, $b]) {

Locale
------

Locale are a set of configuration which describe how to handle different formats of data, such as monetary values, dates and time.

Locales are extracted from the system, and depends on a country name and a language name. For example, `fr-FR` for French French, `nl_NL` for Dutch, or `zh_CN` for Chinese Chinese. 

Locale are supported with the ext/icu extension, and also, natively with the setlocale() function. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   /* Set locale to Dutch */
   setlocale(LC_ALL, 'nl_NL');
   
   /* Output: vrijdag 22 december 1978 */

.. _logical-operator:

Logical operators
-----------------

Logical operators applies four logical functions to booleans. 

+ ``and`` and ``&&``
+ ``or`` and ``||``
+ ``xor`` (no symbolic version for ``xor``)
+ ``!``  (no letter version for ``not``)

The logical operators are either symbolic or letter. Be aware that the symbolic operators have a higher precedence than the letter one, in particular vis-à-vis comparisons.

The logical operators work on various types, and output booleans. They are different from the bitwise operators, which work on the value as a bit level, not as a whole.

---------------

Constants which hold information about the current location of the code.

Those constants are magic, because they have a constant syntax, yet their value may change, even during the execution of the code. 

+ __LINE__	The current line number of the file.
+ __FILE__	The full path and filename of the file with symlinks resolved. If used inside an include, the name of the included file is returned.
+ __DIR__	The directory of the file. If used inside an include, the directory of the included file is returned. This is equivalent to dirname(__FILE__). This directory name does not have a trailing slash unless it is the root directory.
+ __FUNCTION__	The function name, or {closure} for anonymous functions.
+ __CLASS__	The class name. The class name includes the namespace it was declared in (e.g. Foo\Bar). When used in a trait method, __CLASS__ is the name of the class the trait is used in.
+ __TRAIT__	The trait name. The trait name includes the namespace it was declared in (e.g. Foo\Bar).
+ __METHOD__	The class method name.
+ __NAMESPACE__ The name of the current namespace.

Those constants are case insensitive. All those syntax will work : `__METHOD__`, `__method__`, `__method__`.

.. _memoization:

Memoization
-----------

Memoization is an optimisation technique to speed up a function by avoiding re-processing previously calculated results. 

Usually, memoization trades processing time with memory. The best suited situation are when the load takes some time to process, and the result is a small amount of memory, such as a count. 

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   function docs($file) {
       // local cache 
       static $cache = [];
       
       // If it was already cached, use it. 
       // Docs are supported to be constant during the execution
       if (isset($cache[$file])) {
           return $cache[$file];
       }
       
       $cache[$file] = file_get_contents($file) ?? '';

.. _nowdoc:

Nowdocs
-------

Nowdocs is a string syntax, similar to heredoc, and without internal parsing. They are similar to single quoted strings, compared to double quoted ones.

The Nowdocs syntax uses an arbitrary delimiter, which has to be enclosed in single quotes. The same delimiter will mark the end of the string.

Nowdocs are convenient for large amount of text, that has to be hardcoded. Smaller string will be better suited with single-quotes, while even longer text should be stored in an external storage, such as a file.

It is possible to indent the text in a nowdocs string: to avoid this indentation to be passed at execution time, the final delimiter may be indented too. Its indentation will be removed from the parsed text.
 

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $nowdoc = <<<'DELIM'
   This is a long text.
   
   $variable will not be replaced, and the text stays intact.
   
   DELIM;
   
   $nowdoc = <<<'DELIM'
           This still will start at the first word, not at the beginning of the string.

Overwriting is the process to replace a method, property or constant that was defined in a parent, by a local definition. This is related to OOP programming and inheritance.

Overwriting is applicable to constants, methods and properties. Methods still should have a compatible signature with their parent's equivalent, while properties and constants may change their (default) value.

Overwriting is prevented by the ``final`` keyword, or the ``private`` visibility.

Overwriting is also called overloading.

.. _by-reference:

Passing By Reference
--------------------

When calling a method, or returning from it, data may be passed by value or by reference. 

By reference, a reference to the the data is passed : any modification on that value inside the method will be reflected in the original value. 

This is the alternative way of passing data to methods : the default way is to use by value, which copies the data. 

Passing by reference is the default behavior with object. Otherwise, it needs to be declared with the ``&`` operator, in the function signature.

Returned value are passed back to the calling context with the same rule than for parameters.

This is the default way of passing data to methods : the alternative way is to use by reference. 

Passing by value may be memory-intensive when passing a large array. This is not the case for objects, which are always passed by reference.

Returned value are passed back to the calling context with the same rule than for parameters.

.. _profiler:

PHP Profiler
------------

A profiler is an application that helps track execution performances, and spots slow part of the application for optimisation.

PHP has several profilers. They may provide an online interface to visualize the results, or a local server, or even a raw execution breakdown, which may then be processed to identify the bottlenecks.
 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // code to use with PHP-spx, one of PHP profilers
   
   while ($task = get_next_ready_task()) {
     spx_profiler_start();
     try {
       $task->process();
     } finally {
       spx_profiler_stop();

.. _psr:

PHP Standards Recommendations (PSR)
-----------------------------------

PHP Standards Recommendations. This is a set of rules and best practices, that may be adopted by any PHP project. It will help adopt common behavior and improve collaboration between projects.

PSR are edited by the PHP-FIG : Framework Interoperability Group.

There are 22 PSR at the moment, covering subjects such as cache, factories, log, coding standards,...

.. _php-variable:

PHP variables
-------------

PHP provides a large number of predefined variables. They may be super-global, and available in any context, such as `$_GET`, or classic variable, in the global scope, such as `$argv`.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   print_r($_GET);
   print_r($argv);
   print_r($GLOBALS);
   
   function foo() {
       global $argc;
   }
   
   ?>

.. _phpinfo:

phpinfo()
---------

phpinfo() is one of the most famous PHP function. It outputs information about PHP's configuration, in HTML format. 

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   // Show all information, defaults to INFO_ALL
   phpinfo();
   ?>


`Documentation <https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.phpinfo>`__

Added in PHP 4.0

.. _plus:

plus +
------

`+` is a native PHP operator, which may have three meaning : 

+ The addition, as in mathematics. This works on integers and double.
+ The merging of arrays. This merging will set the keys once, then omit the next values.
+ The + sign in front of a number, to make it explicitely positive. This is optional, and may be repeated.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $a = 1 + 2; // 3
   
   $b = [1, 2] + [3, 4, 5]; // [1,2, 5]
   
   ?>


`Documentation <https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.operators.arithmetic.php>`__

.. _positional-parameter:

Positional Parameters
---------------------

Argument which are identified by their position in the signature or the call. This is the traditional way of sending arguments to a method. 

The alternative way is to use named parameters.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   function foo($a, $b) {
       return $a - $b;
   }
   
   echo foo(2, 3);  // return -1
   echo foo(3, 2);  // return 1
   
   echo foo(a: 2, b: 3);  // return -1
   echo foo(b: 2, a: 3);  // return 1
   
   ?>

.. _precedence:

Precedence
----------

Precedence organizes the way operators are executed, when they are mixed in the same expression.

For example, `1 + 2 * 3` will produce `7`, since `*` has a higher precedence than `+`. 

Every operator has a precedence, and when they have the same precedence, the rightmost one yield to the leftmost one.

Precedence offers some reading surprises to human readers. For example, `! $b instanceof \X` really applies `instanceof` first, and `&&` has a higher priority than `and`, even though they perform the same function.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   var_dump(!$b instanceof \X);
   var_dump($a = 1 and 2);
   
   ?>

.. _predefined-constant:

Predefined Constants
--------------------

Predefined constants are PHP native constants, available at the start of the PHP engine. 

Those constants are for internal usage, such as E_ALL, for error reporting, or STDOUT, for output. Some constants are providing information, such as PHP_VERSION's PHP version number. Others are meant to give a readable name to common values or arguments, such as DATE_RFC822. 

Other constants come from extensions : for example, the Math extension defines M_PI for the pi constant (3.14159...), libsodium defines SODIUM_CRYPTO_CORE_RISTRETTO255_SCALARBYTES, etc. Those are also predefined constants, although they depend on the compilation of PHP.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   echo This is PHP.PHP_VERSION;
   
   ?>


`Documentation <https://www.php.net/manual/en/reserved.constants.php>`__

.. _preprocess:

Preprocess
----------

Preprocessing is an optimisation technique, where a value is calculated even before the execution of a script. This is only possible with constants values, which are known before execution.

Preprocessing may save execution time, and memory. 

In terms of maintenance, it hides some implementation details in the result : one has to guess where this value is coming from.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $seconds = 60;
   $minutes = 60;
   
   $hours = $seconds * $minutes;
   
   // this variable may be preprocessed, saving the calculation at execution time.
   $hours = 3600;
   
   ?>
   


`Documentation <https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.locale.php>`__

.. _private:

private Keyword
---------------

The private keyword is part of the three keywords to define visibility of a method, property or constant. It is the strictest level of visibility : it restrict usage to the current class only. Child class can't redefine it, nor access it.

The private keyword cannot be used with the final keyword : a private method is not visible in the child classes, and can't also be redefined.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class x {
       private const X = 1;
       
       final public function method() { 
           echo self::X;

.. _promoted-property:

Promoted Properties
-------------------

Promoted properties are a class's arguments, which are declared as properties and automatically assigned their value at instantiation.

   <?php
   // Show all information, defaults to INFO_ALL
   phpinfo();
   ?>

.. _property:

Properties
----------

Class properties are variables, local to the class.

They might have visibility, chosen among : public (default), protected and private.

They might have a default value. By default it is null.

They might have a typehint, since PHP 7.4

They might be readonly, for properties which are only set once, and cannot be modified. 

They might be static, and not related to an object, but to a class. 

Property should be uniquely defined in a class. They may be redefined in children or parent when the visibility allows it.

.. _random:

Random
------

Random generators generates numbers or strings. 

random_bytes(), random_int() and openssl_random_pseudo_bytes() produce pseudo-random data, suitable for cryptography. 

Traditional native functions, such as rand() and mt_rand() are not recommended for cryptography. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   $bytes = random_bytes(5);

Added in PHP 4.0

.. _readonly:

Readonly
--------

A property can be declared with the readonly modifier, which prevents modification of the property after initialization.

Readonly also applies inside the __clone() magic method : cloning doesn't allow for changing a readonly property.

In PHP 8.2, a class may be readonly, making all of of its properties readonly too. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class Test {
      public readonly string $prop;
   
      public function __construct(string $prop) {
          // Legal initialization.
          $this->prop = $prop;
      }
   }
   
   $test = new Test(foobar);
   // Legal read.
   var_dump($test->prop); // string(6) foobar
   
   // Illegal reassignment. It does not matter that the assigned value is the same.
   $test->prop = foobar;

.. _real:

Real Numbers
------------

Real numbers is a synonym for floating point numbers (see related). There used to be ``real`` dedicated structures in PHP (like is_real() or (real)), though, they were removed..

In case of doubt, you should read about ``floats``.

   <?php
     preg_match('/(foo)(bar)(baz)/', 'foobarbaz', $matches, PREG_OFFSET_CAPTURE);
     print_r($matches);
   ?>


`Documentation <https://www.php.net/preg_match>`__

.. _resource:

resource
--------

A resource is a special type of data, holding a reference to an external resource. Resources are created and used by special functions. 

Resources are only used with their dedicated functions. It is not possible to modify them in any other way.

Resources, in general, are removed from PHP code and more recent version tend to rely less on them. 

There is a list of PHP resources : `List of Resource Types <https://www.php.net/manual/en/resource.php>`_.


.. code-block:: php

Return
------

return returns program control to the calling module. Execution resumes at the expression following the called module's invocation.

.. _returntypewillchange:

Return Type Will Change
-----------------------

This is a native PHP attribute, which tells the engine that method overwriting some native methods will change the returntype.

To avoid using that attribute, one must made the return type compatible with PHP signatures.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class Foo implements ArrayAccess {
       #[\ReturnTypeWillChange]
       public function offsetGet(mixed $offset) {}

.. _return-typehint:

Return Typehint
---------------

Return typehints are the types used for the return values of a method or function. 

They are the same as the argument types, with a few addition : 

+ `void`, which means that no value is returned. (No usage of return, or return with no explicit value)
+ `never`, which means that the function won't return : either it will kill the application, or it will throw an exception.

Return types are ignored when the method throws an exception. 

return typehint are covariant : they get more or equally precise with each new child generation. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   function foo() : bool {
       if (rand(0,1)) {
           return true;
       } else {

.. _return-value:

Return Value
------------

Return value is the value returned, at the end of a method call. That value may be typed with a data typehint. It may also be typed with `never`, in case the method doesn't return, or `void`, when the method returns nothing. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   function foo() : int {
       return 1;
   }
   
   function goo() : never {

Scalar Typehints
----------------

In its simplest form, a yield statement looks much like a return statement, except that instead of stopping execution of the function and returning, yield instead provides a value to the code looping over the generator and pauses execution of the generator function. 

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   function gen_one_to_three() {
       for ($i = 1; $i <= 3; $i++) {

Session
-------

Session support in PHP consists of a way to preserve certain data across subsequent accesses.

It relies on the session_* functions, and the ``$_SESSION`` superglobal variable.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   if (isset($_SESSION['x'])) {
       print x was already set with the value.$_SESSION['x'];

.. _shallow-clone:

Shallow clone
-------------

A shallow clone is an object cloning, where the cloned object keeps the same object properties as the original object. This is a fast way to share data between objects.

Shallow cloning is the default behavior in PHP.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class Dog {
       private $name = '';
       private Address $address;
   
       function __construct(string $name, Address $address) {

.. _short-assignation:

Short assignations
------------------

In addition to the basic assignment operator, there are combined operators for all of the binary arithmetic, array union and string operators that allow you to use a value in an expression and then set its value to the result of that expression.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // incrementing $a by one
   $a = $a + 1;
   
   // short assignement for the above syntax

.. _short-syntax:

Short Syntax
------------

A short syntax is the fusion of an operator with the `=` operator. That way, the operator is applied to the right hand operand, and the left variable, then, assigned to that variable. 

It is convenient when the variable has to be assigned again to itself.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $a = 0;
   // Adds 2 to $a
   $a = $a + 2;
   
   // short syntax to add 3 to $a
   $a += 3;

.. _short-tag:

Short Tags
----------

PHP uses special tags to identify code that has to be executed. The short tags are a special set of PHP tag, shorter than the usual ``<?php``. It was simply ``<?``.

Short tags may be disabled in PHP configuration, with the ``short_open_tag`` directive. 

Short tags are different from echo tags : those tags immediately display data.

From the manual : As short tags can be disabled it is recommended to only use the normal tags (<?php ?> and <?= ?>) to maximise compatibility. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   echo 1;
   ?>
   
   <? 
   // this is a short tag

.. _signature:

signature
---------

The signature of a method or a function is the list of arguments and constraints that applies when calling it. 

In its simplest form, signature of a method is its argument's type and list, though modern syntax should also include default values, visibilities and parameter names.


.. code-block:: php

.. _sleep:

sleep
-----

sleep() is a PHP function which stops the execution for a given number of seconds. In web security, stopping a process makes it vulnerable to DOS attack : the process will wait, doing nothing yet using resources, allowing an attacker to saturate the server.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php

.. _spaeceship:

Spaceship operator
------------------

Spaceship operator is an operator which reports if a value is larger, equal or smaller than another value. It return 1, 0 or -1 in each case, respectively. 

The spaceship operator may be replace by a `-` (minus) sign, if the compared values are correct. It may also be replace with `!=`, since -1 and 1 are both cast to `true`. 

The spaceship operator got its name from the ressemblence to an flying saucer. Battleship operator, or death star operator do not exist.

PHP defines some special typehints.

+ mixed : any type
+ void : no returned value
+ callable : may be used as a callback
+ iterable : may be used with foreach(), including array
+ never : never returns
+ object : object of any class
+ parent : any of the parent class of the current class, excluding it
+ self : the current class
+ static : the current called class

Other special types are the scalar types.

SSL
---

SSL, the Secure Sockets Layer, is a cryptographic protocol designed to provide communications security over a computer network and on the Web. SSL is often related to HTTPS, for secured transmission with the HTTP protocol, although HTTPS has moved from SSL to TLS.

SSL is a PHP context for sockets, and share the configuration options with TLS.

.. _spl:

Standard PHP Library (SPL)
--------------------------

The Standard PHP Library (SPL) is a collection of interfaces and classes that are meant to solve common problems.

SPL offers features, functions, classes and interfaces in many different fields : iterators, data structures, files, exceptions, and observers. 

One of the most famous SPL features is the function spl_autoload_register(), which register an autoload handler.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // SPL and autoloading
   spl_autoload_register(function ($class) {
       include 'classes/' . $class . '.class.php';
   });
   
   if ($object instanceof Countable) {
       $count = count($object);
   } elseif ($object instanceof Traversable)
       $count = iterator_count($object);
   } else {
       print Can


.. _static:

static
------

Static has many distinct usages.

Static is one of the three special keywords that are used to access properties or methods from inside the class definition. It relates to the current called class.

Static is a keyword for methods and properties : they are turned into class elements, and should be reached with the :: syntax, instead of -> or ?->.

Static is a keyword for closures and arrow functions : it prevents the current scope to be included in with the closure, thus limiting the number of accessible values.

Static is a keyword for variables : those variables will not be removed at the end of the method execution and will be available at the beginning of the next call.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class X {
       private const X = 1;
       
       function foo() {
           return static::1;
   
           // same as \X::C; when the object is of class X
           // same as \Y::C; when the object is of class W
       }
   }
   
   class Y extends X {
       private const X = 2;
   }
   
   ?>

.. _static-method:

Static Method
-------------

Static methods are methods defined with the static keyword. They have to be called with the name of the class, rather than instantiated object. 

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class x {
       static function foo() {
           echo __METHOD__;
       }

   <?php
   
   class x {
       static $p = 1;
   }
   
   //displays x::foo
   print x::$p;

.. _stdclass:

stdclass
--------

Stdclass is a native PHP class. It is the class used when a generic object is created, for example with json_decode() or the (object) cast operator.

The stdClass is allowed to create dynamic properties on the fly, as its base definition has none. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class X {
       private $property = 1;
       
       function foo() {
           // dynamic property

.. _strict-comparison:

Strict Comparison
-----------------

Strict comparison is a comparison operator or a control structure that checks not only the value but also the type of the value. In other words, it does not apply any type-juggling to the values before processing. 

Here are the strict operators : ``==`` may be replaced with ``===``,  ``!=`` may be replaced with ``!==``, ``switch`` may be replaced with ``match``, in_array() with the third parameter ``strict`` set to true. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   //true
   var_dump(1 == 1);
   //false
   var_dump(1 === 1);
   
   //true
   var_dump(null == 0);
   //false
   var_dump(null === 0);

.. _string:

String
------

A string is series of characters, where a character is the same as a byte. This means that PHP only supports a 256-character set, and hence does not offer native Unicode support. 

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $string = 'Hello world';
   
   ?>

.. _string-interpolation:

String Interpolation
--------------------

String interpolation is a feature where variables inside a string are dynamically replaced by their value at execution time. 

There are several ways to do interpolation : 

+ use double-quotes and a variable
+ use double-quotes and a property or a array with a valid index
+ use curly braces with a variable
+ use dollar and curly-braces : it will call the variable whose name is dynamically calculated in the curly braces. This syntax will be deprecated in PHP 8.2 and later.

Double quotes and Heredoc notation allows string interpolation. On the other hand, single quote and nowdoc forbid interpolation. Then, escaping the special characters such as `$` and `{` with `\\` will also disable interpolation locally.

Interpolation happens inside strings, while concatenation happens between strings.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $world = 'world';
   // This is an interpolated string
   $string = Hello $world;
   
   // This is not an interpolated string
   $string = 'Hollow $world';

   <?php
   
   class x implements stringable {
       protected function __toString() : string {

.. _supply-chain-attack:

Supply Chain Attack
-------------------

Supply Chain Attack is a security attack that uses dependencies to infect a program.

Modern applications are built on top of components which are fetched from central repositories. In the PHP world, composer is the most popular PHP repository.

When those external repositories are infected with malicious component or code, the dependency manager will load them like the rest of the code. Blind trust in the imported code lead to vulnerabilities.

Use
---

The use operator has three distinct usage. 

The use operator allows the import and aliasing of fully qualified names (such as classes, interfaces, constants, ...)  in the current namespace. 

When `use` used inside a class or a trait, it imports a trait and its methods and properties. 

When `use` is used with a closure, it imports the listed variables in the closure, from the defining environment.

Variables
---------

Variables holds data when processing a PHP script.

.. _variadic:

Variadic
--------

Three dots, aka ellipsis, is an operator to spread or collect array values. 

Applied to an array, it will spread the values of the array as distinct elements.

Used in a function signature, it will collect all the values into one array.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $array = [1, 2, 3];
   
   // same as foo(0, 1,2, 3);
   foo(0, ...$array, 4);
   
   
   function foo($special, ...$others) {
       // with the above call
       // $special === 0
       // $others === [1, 2, 3, 4]
   }
   
   ?>

.. _visibility:

Visibility
----------

Properties, methods and classes may have a visibility. It limits the scope of the definition :

+ private : to the current class
+ protected : to the current class hierarchy (parents and children classes)
+ public : to all the code



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class x {
       public const X = 1;
       
       private $property;
       
       protected function foo() {}
   }
   
   ?>

.. _void:

Void
----

Functions declared with void as their return type must either omit their return statement altogether, or use an empty return statement. null is not a valid return value for a void function. 

Void function may throw exceptions or return without a parameter.

Null and void are two different notions. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   function foo(&$a) : void {
       $a++;
       
       // No return used here
   }
   
   $b = 0;
   foo($b);
   
   ?>

.. _wrapper:

Wrapper
-------

A Wrapper is a custom way to access remote resources. It is designed to look like accessing to file, on the file system, but using other drivers than the ones of the hard drive. It is based on a configuration string, which looks like a URL : `ftp://www.site.com/file.txt`, where the part before the `://` is the protocol.

Among the predefined PHP wrapper, there are http://, ftp://, zlib://, phar://, rar://, expect://. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $html = file_get_content('http://www.php.net/');
   
   ?>

.. _xml:

XML
---

XML (Extensible Markup Language) is a markup language similar to HTML, but without predefined tags to use.

PHP offers several set of functions to handle XML : domxml, simplexml, xmlreader, xmlwriter.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   $string = <<<XML
   <?xml version='1.0'?>
   <document>
       <cmd>login</cmd>
       <login>Richard</login>
   </document>
   XML;
                                                                          
                                             
   $xml = simplexml_load_string($string);
   print_r($xml);
   
   ?>

.. _yield:

Yield
-----

In its simplest form, a yield statement looks much like a return statement, except that instead of stopping execution of the function and returning, yield instead provides a value to the code looping over the generator and pauses execution of the generator function. 

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   function gen_one_to_three() {
       for ($i = 1; $i <= 3; $i++) {
           // Note that $i is preserved between yields.
           yield $i;
       }
   }
   
   ?>

.. _yield-from:

yield from Keyword
------------------

Generator delegation allows you to yield values from another generator, Traversable object, or array by using the yield from keyword.

.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
   function inner() {
       yield 1; // key 0
       yield 2; // key 1
       yield 3; // key 2
   }
   function gen() {
       yield 0; // key 0
       yield from inner(); // keys 0-2
       yield 4; // key 1
   }
   // pass false as second parameter to get an array [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
   var_dump(iterator_to_array(gen()));
   ?>

.. _yoda:

Yoda condition
--------------

Yoda condition is a way to write condition by using any literal value on the left, instead of the right.

This prevents errors where the comparison operator is shortened, and turned into an assignation, which is usually true. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // Yoda condition
   if (0 == $a) {}
   
   // Assignation, instead of comparison and bug
   if ($a = 0) {}
   
   ?>
