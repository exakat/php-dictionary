.. _$_files:

$_FILES
-------

In PHP, the ``$_FILES`` variable is a special superglobal variable that is used to retrieve information about files uploaded to the server via HTML forms with the ``enctype="multipart/form-data"`` attribute. It provides access to the uploaded file's properties such as name, size, type, and temporary location on the server.

When a file upload form is submitted, PHP populates the ``$_FILES`` variable with an array structure that contains information about the uploaded files. The array is organized based on the input field names used in the form.

+ ``$_FILES['userfile']['name']`` : the original name of the file on the client machine.
+ ``$_FILES['userfile']['type']`` : the mime type of the file, if the browser provided this information. An example would be "image/gif". This mime type is however not checked on the PHP side and therefore don't take its value for granted.
+ ``$_FILES['userfile']['size']`` : the size, in bytes, of the uploaded file.
+ ``$_FILES['userfile']['tmp_name']`` : the temporary filename of the file in which the uploaded file was stored on the server.
+ ``$_FILES['userfile']['error']`` : the error code associated with this file upload.
+ ``$_FILES['userfile']['full_path']`` : the full path as submitted by the browser. This value does not always contain a real directory structure, and cannot be trusted. Available as of PHP 8.1.0.

``$_FILES`` is associated to the functions move_uploaded_file() and is_uploaded_file().


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
       // $a->file was filled with $_FILES at some point
       move_uploaded_file($a->file['tmp_name'], $target);
   
   ?>

.. _$_get:

$_GET
-----

In PHP, the ``$_GET`` variable is a special superglobal variable that is used to retrieve data from the query string or URL parameters. When a user submits a form using the HTTP GET method or includes parameters in the URL, PHP populates the ``$_GET`` variable with key-value pairs representing those parameters.

The ``$_GET`` variable is an associative array where the keys are the parameter names and the values are the corresponding values passed in the URL. 

The received values are strings or arrays. They are strings by default, and other scalar types needs a casting to have the correct type. The values are arrays when the URL uses the `[]` format : that format handles arrays and map.  

$_GET is a superglobal : it is always available, in every scope.

Values inside $_GET are always strings, or arrays. `https://www.site.com/index.php?x=1` or `https://www.site.com/index.php?x[2]=1`.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // https://www.example.com/index.php?x=1
   $_GET['x'] === '1';
   
   // https://www.example.com/index.php?y=abc
   $_GET['y'] === 'abc';
   
   // https://www.example.com/index.php?z[]=def&z[][]=ghi
   $_GET['z'] === array('def', array('ghi'));
   
   ?>

.. _$_post:

$_POST
------

An associative array of variables, transmitted to the current script via the HTTP POST method, with the MIME types `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` or `multipart/form-data`.

The received values are all strings or arrays. They are strings by default, and other scalar types needs a casting. The values are arrays when the URL uses the `[]` format. 

$_POST is a superglobal : it is always available, in every scope.

Values inside $_POST are always strings, or arrays.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // POST x=1
   $_POST['x'] === '1';
   
   // POST y=abc

.. _$_request:

$_REQUEST
---------

An associative array of variables, transmitted to the current script via the HTTP GET and HTTP methods.

When the same name is used both in GET and POST method, the priority is defined by the `variable_order` directive. 

The received values are all strings or arrays. They are strings by default, and other scalar types needs a casting. The values are arrays when the URL uses the `[]` format. 

$_REQUEST is a superglobal : it is always available, in every scope.


.. code-block:: php

.. _$argc:

$argc
-----

In PHP, ``$argc`` is a predefined variable that holds the number of arguments passed to the script when it is executed from the command line. It represents the argument count (hence the name $argc).

When a PHP script is run from the command line, the script's filename is counted as the first argument, and any additional arguments passed after the filename are also counted. The value of ``$argc`` will be an integer indicating the total number of arguments.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   echo $argc;
   
   ?>

.. _$argv:

$argv
-----

$argv is a PHP variable that contains an array of the arguments passed to the PHP script, in command line. $argv is not defined when PHP is run in a webserver.

$argv is not a super global : it has to be imported in a non-global scope with the global keyword.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   print_r($argv);

.. _$HTTP_RAW_POST_DATA:

$HTTP_RAW_POST_DATA
-------------------

`$HTTP_RAW_POST_DATA` used to contain the raw POST data of an HTTP request. 

Since PHP 7.0, ``php://input`` should be used instead of `$HTTP_RAW_POST_DATA`.  

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
       // $a->file was filled with $_FILES at some point
       move_uploaded_file($a->file['tmp_name'], $target);
   
   ?>


`Documentation <https://www.php.net/manual/en/reserved.variables.files.php>`__

Removed in PHP 

.. _$php_errormsg:

$php_errormsg
-------------

$php_errormsg contains the last error message, emitted by PHP. 

In general, error_get_last() should be used instead of $php_errormsg, although this function returns an array, not a string.

This feature was removed in PHP 8.0.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // Warning: Undefined variable $php_errormsg 
   // in PHP 8.0 (sic)

.. _$this:

$this
-----

$this is a variable that represents the current object. It is different in each object / class. 

$this is also called a pseudo-variable. There is no special variable called `$that`.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class x {
   	private $y = 1;

.. _htaccess:

.htaccess
---------

The .htaccess file is a configuration file used in web servers that support the Apache HTTP Server software. It allows you to configure various aspects of how your web server operates and how it serves web content. The name ``htaccess`` stands for ``hypertext access``, and the file is often referred to as an ``htaccess file``.

.. _-__call:

__call() Method
---------------

__call() is a magic method : it is called when a method cannot be accessed, either because it doesn't exist, or because its visibility prevents it.

That way, it is possible to create dynamically methods, without hardcoding them. 

The __call() method receives the name of the target-method, and a list of argument. 

The __call() method has a related version for static methods, called `__callStatic`.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class x {
   	private $values = ['a' => 1,
   					   'b' => 2,
   					   ];
   
   	// Checks the dictionary, or return 0
   	function __call($name, $args) {
   		if (method_exists($this, $name)) {

.. _-__clone:

__clone
-------

To clone an object is the creation of a new distinct object, from an existing one. This is basically a copy, although the object itself is multiplied by call the clone operator.

By default PHP does a shallow clone, duplicating the scalars (string, integer...) and keeping the same reference to objects. To make a deep clone, the class must define the ``__clone`` magic method.

Cloning is similar to creating another object of the same class, without requiring all the constructor arguments.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $spike = new Dog('Spike', 'Teckel', 'red');
   $medor = clone $spike;
   
   $medor->setCollar('green'); // distinguish spike and medor by collar

.. _-__get:

__get() method
--------------

__get() is a magic method : it is called when a property cannot be access, either because it doesn't exist, or because its visibility prevents it.

That way, it is possible to create dynamically properties, without hardcoding them. 

The __get() method is usually paired with the __set() method. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class x {
   	private $values = ['a' => 1,
   					   'b' => 2,

.. _halt-compiler:

__halt_compiler()
-----------------

Halts the execution of the compiler. This can be useful to embed data in PHP scripts, like the installation files. 

Byte position of the data start can be determined by the ``__COMPILER_HALT_OFFSET__`` constant which is defined only if there is a __halt_compiler() presented in the file. 

Note : this is the documentation from PHP.net.



.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
   
   // adapted from the manual
   
   // open this file
   $fp = fopen(__FILE__, 'r');
   
   // seek file pointer to data
   fseek($fp, __COMPILER_HALT_OFFSET__);
   
   // and output it
   var_dump(stream_get_contents($fp));
   
   // the end of the script execution
   __halt_compiler(); This part of the file is read by the script.

.. _-__invoke:

__invoke
--------

The __invoke() magic method is called when a script calls an object as a function. This type of class is also called a functor. 

The method is able to take an arbitrary number of argument. 

When a class has the ``__invoke`` class, it is possible to can a method without mentioning its name: the object is the method.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   // extracted from the PHP manual
   	class CallableClass
   	{
   	    public function __invoke($x)
   	    {

.. _-__isset:

__isset() method
----------------

__isset() is a magic method : it is called when the existence of a property has to be checked.

That way, it is possible to create dynamically properties, without hardcoding them. 

The __isset() method is usually paired with the __get() and __set() methods. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class x {
   	private $values = ['a' => 1,
   					   'b' => 2,

.. _-__serialize:

__serialize
-----------

The __serialize() magic method is called when a script tries to construct an associative array of key/value pairs that represent the serialized form of the object. 

If no array is returned a ``TypeError`` will be thrown. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   	class WebPage {
   		private $html;
   		private $url;

.. _-__set:

__set() method
--------------

__set() is a magic method : it is called when a property cannot be access, either because it doesn't exist, or because its visibility prevents it. It is used to give a value to the property.

That way, it is possible to create dynamically properties, without hardcoding them. 

The __set() method is usually paired with the __get() method. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php

.. _-__set_state:

__set_state() method
--------------------

__set_state() is a magic method : it is called when an object has been exported with var_export(), and has to be instantiated again. 

__set_state() is tasked with recreating the object, assigning the previous values to it, and recreating any missing properties, such as database connections or resources.

The __set_state() method has no counterpart : var_export() do not use any magic method. 

__set_state() is a static method, unlike the other magic methods.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class x {
   	private $values = ['a' => 1,
   					   'b' => 2,

.. _-__sleep:

__sleep() method
----------------

__sleep() is a magic method : it is called an object is being serialized, so that the object may be cleaned. 

In particular, some resources, such as database connexions or files cannot be serialized. They should be closed, stored as a path, and reopened later with __wakeup().

The __sleep() method is usually paired with the __wakeup() method. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class x {
   	private $file;

.. _-__tostring:

__toString() method
-------------------

__tostring() is a magic method : it is called when the object has to be turned into a string.

That way, it is possible to dynamically convert the object to a string and display it, or transmit it to another part of the application. 

__toString() is called when strict_type is not active. Otherwise, passing an object to a string parameter yields an error.

__toString() is always called in concatenation, and string interpolation.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class x {
   	private $r = 'S';
   	private $p = 1;

.. _-__wakeup:

__wakeup()
----------

__wakeup() is a magic method : it is called an object is being deserialized, so that the object may be restored to its working condition. 

In particular, some resources, such as database connexions or files cannot be serialized. They should be closed, stored as a path in __sleep(), and reopened later with __wakeup().

The __wakeup() method is usually paired with the __sleep() method. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class x {
   	private $file;
   	private $path;
   
   	function __sleep() {

.. _abstract-class:

Abstract Class
--------------

An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly. It has the ``abstract`` option.

An abstract class serves as a blueprint for other classes and is intended to be subclassed. 

An abstract class can contain both regular methods and abstract methods. Regular methods provide common functionality that can be inherited by subclasses, while abstract methods are declared without an implementation. Subclasses of an abstract class must provide an implementation for all the abstract methods defined in the abstract class.

   <?php
   abstract class AbstractClass { }

.. _abstract:

Abstract Keyword
----------------

PHP has abstract classes and methods. Classes defined as abstract cannot be instantiated, and any class that contains at least one abstract method must also be abstract.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   abstract class AbstractClass
   {
       // Force Extending class to define this method
       abstract protected function getValue();
       abstract protected function prefixValue($prefix);
   
       // Common method
       public function printOut() {
           print $this->getValue() . "\n";

.. _abstraction-layer:

Abstraction Layer
-----------------

An abstraction layer is a piece of software that offer the same API to access multiple similar components. 

The underlying components may be of various shapes : PDO offers an abstraction layer to databases, streams offer an abstraction layer to files, etc.

league/flysystem offers also an abstraction layer to filesystem, lcobucci/clock offers an abstraction to clocks.

.. _accessibility:
.. _a11y:

Accessibility
-------------

Accessibility is the process to make the code accessible to everyone. 

PHP code being text, its accessibility relies on the IDE. The main accessible feature is the usage of tabulations, instead of multiple spaces.

Accessibility is also called `a11y`, aka a, 11 letters and y. This is shorter to write.

.. _active-record:

Active Record
-------------

Active Record is a design pattern commonly used in PHP development. It provides an object-oriented approach to interact with a database table or view. In the Active Record pattern, each table or view in the database is represented by a corresponding class in the PHP code.

The main purpose of Active Record is to encapsulate the database access logic within the objects themselves. This means that an Active Record object not only represents a single row of data, but it also includes methods to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on that data.

With Active Record, developers can easily create, retrieve, update, and delete records from the database by invoking methods on the corresponding objects. The Active Record object abstracts away the SQL queries and provides a more intuitive and object-oriented way to work with the data.

Additionally, Active Record allows developers to add domain logic to the objects. This means that business rules and validations can be implemented directly within the Active Record classes. For example, you can define methods to validate input, perform calculations, or enforce certain constraints on the data.

Active Record is often used in conjunction with other design patterns, such as the Data Mapper pattern. While Active Record focuses on the direct interaction between objects and the database, the Data Mapper pattern separates the database access logic into a separate layer, providing more flexibility and decoupling between the domain objects and the persistence layer.

Adapters
--------

Adapters are the link between the application and the rest of the universe. They take incoming data and shape them into internal format, and vice-versa.

Adapters are heavily used in hexagonal architecture. They area also a classic design pattern.

.. _addition:

Addition
--------

PHP additions apply to two different types : numbers and arrays.

For numbers, aka integers or float, this is the classic mathematical addition. 

For arrays, this is a special version of array merge : the arrays are merged, and keys are kept once they are written. This features only exists for addition and arrays. Substraction is not available. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $a = 1 + 2.3; // 3.3
   
   $b = [1] + [3, 4]; // [1, 4]

.. _alias:

Alias
-----

An alias is a distinct name for an existing named structure. It is a classic way to cope with possible naming conflict, and improve readability. 

For example, there are aliases in namespaces import, to disambiguate classes, traits, interfaces, enums, functions and constants from other namespaces. There is also the class_alias() function, which allows the application-wide creation of aliases. 

There are also aliases for methods, when importing them from a trait. 

References are also considered an alias, as they stand for a variable with another name. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   use stdClass as StandardClass;
   
   foreach($map as $key => $value) {
   	print "$key => $value\n";

.. _alias-types:
.. _type-alias:

Alias Types
-----------

An alias type is a short name for several types at once. Under the hood, alias types are union type. 

PHP has some native alias types, such as iterable, which represents array | Traversable. Alias type are not available for customisation. 

The same rules applies to alias types than other types : for example, array | iterable produces a 'Duplicate type array is redundant' error.

.. _allowdynamicproperty:

Allow Dynamic Property
----------------------

This is a native PHP attribute, which tells the engine that a class can dynamically create properties without declaring them.

This attribute may be added to any class. It is not necessary with `stdClass`.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class MyClass {
   	function foo() {
   		// creation of a property, without prior definition
   		// This yields an error

.. _alternative-syntax:

Alternative Syntax
------------------

PHP offers an alternative syntax for some of its control structures; namely, ``if``, ``while``, ``for``, ``foreach``, and ``switch``. In each case, the basic form of the alternate syntax is to change the opening brace to a colon (:) and the closing brace to ``endif;``, ``endwhile;``, ``endfor;``, ``endforeach;``, or ``endswitch;``, respectively.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php if ($a == 5): ?>

.. _annotation:

Annotations
-----------

PHP annotations are a system to provide meta data about code, in a way that is programmatically processable. 

PHP annotations are based on PHPDoc comment's syntax, and are later partially modernized by PHP attributes. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php

.. _anonymous-catch:

Anonymous Catch
---------------

Traditionally, the catch statement requires specifying both an Exception class and an identifier variable to hold the caught exception.

PHP 8.0 introduced a new language constructs that makes the identifier variable optional, allowing for a fully anonymous catch statement. This means there is no need to specify a variable to hold the caught exception.

The motivation behind this proposal is to simplify exception handling code, especially in cases where you don't need to use the caught exception object. It leads to cleaner and more concise code, especially when the specific details of the exception are not interesting and can just be handled generically.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   try {
   	$a / 0;
   } catch (DivisionByZero) {

.. _anonymous-class:

Anonymous Class
---------------

A class may be instantiated, without defining a class name. The class is identical to a named-class, except for the name attribute. This also means that it cannot be used for typehinting, though it may be typed itself, using parent class or implemented interfaces. 

Also, arguments may be passed at instantiation time, unlike with named-class definition, where those arguments are passed when calling ``new``, not when defining the class.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   	interface i {}
   	function foo(i $a) {}
   	
   	$a = new class () implements i {};

Anonymous Function
------------------

A function may be instantiated, without defining a function name. Such functions are called anonymous. 

In PHP, they are defined as closures or arrow functions. They may also be created based on existing methods and functions, with the `...` operator.

Even without names, they are usable just like functions, or as callable.

.. _arbitrary-argument:

Arbitrary Number of Argument
----------------------------

PHP allows any number of arguments to be passed to a functioncall. In the function definition, receiving those arguments means managing an arbitrary number of parameters. 

This is achieved with the variadic operator, or with functions such as func_get_args().

They are also called variable argument lists.

When the arguments are dynamic, aka they are collected at execution time, the operator variadic or the function call_user_func_array() turns an array to arguments.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   function foo(...$args) {
       print "This function is called with ".count($args)." arguments\n";
       print "This function is called with ".func_get_count()." arguments\n";
       print "This function is called with ".count($func_get_args())." arguments\n";
   } 
   
   $array = range(0, rand(5, 10)); // generates an array with 1 to 11 elements
   
   foo(...$array);
   call_user_func_array('foo', $array));

array is the array structure in PHP. 

It may be written as array() or with square brackets `[]`.

An array assigns automatically an integer index to the values appended to it. An arbitrary index may be assigned with the => syntax, or when accessing an element in the array. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $array = array(1, 2, 3);

Array Append
------------

Append is an array operation, which adds an element at the end of the array. It is also called a push.

There are two operators for this feature ; the ``[]`` operator, which has to be placed after a variable or member. There is also the array_push() function, which is available as a callback, unlike the operator.

The opposite operation is a pop, with the function array_pop(). Array_unshift() is the append at the beginning of the array. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $array = [1, 2, 3];
   $array[] = 4;
   
   $array []= 5; // Same as above, with a notation similar to a short assignation

ArrayObject
-----------

``ArrayObject`` is a native class that provides the functionality of an array with the added features of an object. It extends the base ``ArrayObject`` class and implements the ``ArrayAccess``, ``Countable``, ``IteratorAggregate``, and ``Serializable`` interfaces.

With ``ArrayObject``, it is possible to create objects that have the behavior of arrays, meaning it is possible to access array elements as properties and use object-oriented methods to manipulate the array. 

Operator such as append ``[]``, or foreach() loops are then available with those objects.

.. _assertion:
.. _assert:

Assertions
----------

Assertions are checks that take effect in development and testing environments, but are optimised away to have zero cost in production. 

Assertions are disabled in production, by using the `zend.assertions` directive. Then, they are said 'zero-cost' : they are completely removed from the code, and not executed.

Assertions are a development tool, and should not be used in production. Be aware that the removal of the assertion may leave the system running with unchecked data. 

There are packages providing assertions features and more.




.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $a = foo();
   assert($a !== null, 'Sorry, we got a NULL from foo()!');
   
   ?>

.. _asset:

Asset
-----

Web assets, or also assets, is an encompassing term, that designates all essential elements necessary for the successful execution of a web-based project. Specifically, in the context of web design and development, these 'assets' pertain to diverse components, such as CSS, JS libraries, textual content, graphics, photographs, videos, and audio files.

Assets are often reduced to their URL, which might be hard coded or dynamically generated.

.. _assignation:
.. _assignement:

Assignations
------------

Assignation refers to the process of assigning a value to a variable. It is a fundamental concept in programming that allows to store and manipulate data.

The main operator of assignation is `=`. There are secondary operators, such as `+=`, `*=`, ``??=``, ... which are called short assignation : they apply a specific operation while assigning.

Finally, there are some inherent assignations: foreach() loops, method calls and list() operator performs assignations without an explicit operator.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $a = 'b';
   
   // $c is assigned by 
   foreach([1, 2, 3] as $c) {}
   echo $c; // $c is 3
   
   // list call that assigns values
   [$a, $b, $c] = ['a', 'b', 'C'];
   
   ?>

.. _assumption:

Assumption
----------

An assumption is a piece of code that makes use of knowledge that is not visible in the script. 

Assumptions are often related to arrays : after checking that a variable is of type array, some specific index are used, while there is not guarantee that they are available.

Assumptions may be upgraded to assertions. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
   
   function foo($o) {
   	if ($o instanceof A) {
   		print $o->getName();
   	} else {
   		// if $o is not an object of type A, then it is an array. Where does this come from? 
   		print $o['name'];
   
   		// if $o is an array, is 'name' always available?
   		
   	}
   }
   
   ?>

.. _attribute-class:

Attribute Class
---------------

This is a native PHP attribute, which tells the engine that a class is a PHP attribute.

This attribute (sic) is not necessary to make a class a valid attribute. Yet, it is recommended to use it and make the classes explicitly attributes.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   #[Attribute]
   class MyAttribute { }

.. _authenticate:

Authenticate
------------

Functions declared with void as their return type must either omit their return statement altogether, or use an empty return statement. null is not a valid return value for a void function. 

Void function may throw exceptions or return without a parameter.

Null and void are two different notions. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   function foo(&$a) : void {
       $a++;

Autovivification
----------------

Autovivification is the automatic creation of an array when a value is dereferenced.

Autovivification from scalars, including true, is deprecated since PHP 7.4 and removed in PHP 8.0. 

Autovivification from false is deprecated since PHP 8.1. 

Autovivification from null is valid.

.. code-block:: php

.. _auto-wiring:

Autowiring
----------

Autowiring is the ability of the framework to inject dependencies, based on the constructor signature.

Autowiring is based on types. 

Several PHP frameworks offer autowiring : Laravel, Netter, Slim, Symfony.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class Renderer {
   	private View $view;

.. _enum-backed:

Backed Enumeration
------------------

Backed enumerations are enumerations whose cases have a built-in scalar equivalent. The scalars may be integers or strings.

There are methods to convert a scalar value to an enumeration's case, notably from() and tryFrom(). On the other way, the cases have a property called ``value``.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   enum Suit: string
   {
       case Hearts   = 'H';
       case Diamonds = 'D';

.. _best-practice:

Best Practices
--------------

Best practices, or also called good practices, are rules and guidelines that are known to produce a desirable outcome. 

For example, 'comment the code', 'use meaningful names' and 'optimisation is the root of all evil' are such rules. 

Best practices are often grouped in a ruleset, such as SOLID, DRY or Calisthenics. 

It takes some effort to understand the value of the rules, without running into the errors they protect against.

.. _bitshift:

Bitshift Operators
------------------

Bitshift operators ``<<`` and ``>>`` move bits within an integer. The bits are shifted by an number of position, to the right or to the left. They are equivalent to multiplying or divising by a power of 2. 

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $a = 3;       // binary : 11
   echo $a >> 1; // binary : 1 (the last 1 is lost)

Bitwise Operators
-----------------

Bitwise operators evaluate specific bits within an integer. 

Bitwise operators are convenient to handle bit fields. 

On the other hand, logical operators convert the whole value to bool before manipulation.

.. _variable-blind:
.. _blind-variable:

Blind Variable
--------------

Blind variables are variables dedicated to a loop. They have a local use, within this loop and rarely after that. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   foreach($array as $blind => $blindToo) {
       doSomething($blind, $blindToo);
   }
   
   for($i = 0; $i < 10;  ++$i)
       doSomething($i);
   }
   
   ?>


.. _block:

Block
-----

Blocks are none, one or more instructions, grouped together with or without curly brackets.

Blocks may require brackets, like for classes, switch(), function bodies; they might be optional, like with cases, arrow-functions or loops. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   function foo($a) {
   	if ($a) {
   		$b = 1;
   	} else 
   		$b = 2;
   		
   	return $b;
   }
   ?>


.. _boolean:
.. _bool:

Boolean
-------

A boolean is a value that is either true or false. 

PHP's boolean are constants. They may be prefixed by ``\\``, and are case-insensitive. They can't be redefined in namespaces.

There are rules to convert any data to a boolean. 

Booleans have a related scalar typehint : ``bool``. There is also a special ``false`` typehint. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $a = True;
   $b = \FALSE;

.. _break:

Break
-----

Break is a control structure, which ends execution of the current for, foreach, while, do-while or switch structure.

break accepts an optional argument, which tells how many enclosing structures are to be broken out of. 

break should not be confused with `continue` : continue doesn't work in a switch, like a break does.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   foreach([1,2,3] as $b) {
       // break upon the first even number
       if ($b % 2 == 0) {

.. _bucket:

Bucket
------

The term ``bucket`` is not commonly associated with a specific concept. In a more general sense, the term ``bucket`` is often used in the context of data structures and algorithms to refer to a container or a storage space for holding elements.

For example, in the context of hashing or hash tables, a ``bucket`` may be used to describe the individual storage locations where key-value pairs are stored. When a hash collision occurs (two keys hash to the same location), the elements with the same hash value are often placed in a bucket, which is a data structure that allows multiple elements to be stored at the same location.

.. _cache:

Cache
-----

Cache, or caching, is a technique used to store and reuse the results of expensive operations to improve performance.

There are different types of caches, depending on where they are applied: opcode cache, data cache, query cache, etc.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $count = count($array);
   // $count is a cache for the number of elements in the array
   // it saves a call to count() for every loop
   
   for($i = 0; $i < $count; ++$i) {
   	doSomething($i);

.. _callable:

Callables
---------

Callables are objects that can pass the callable typehint. 

Callable may be callbacks, closures or arrow functions. 

Classes may also be callable, when they implement the magic method __invoke().



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   function foo() { echo __METHOD__; }
   
   call_user_func('foo');
   
   ?>

.. _callback:

Callback
--------

Callback are functions which are used as parameters for other functions. Such functions are used to customize the main function. For example, array_map(), which applies a callback to every element of an array, or usort(), which sorts an array using a function.

Callback is akin to a functioncall : it is actually hidden inside the caller function. 

Callback may be build with on closures, arrow-functions, native PHP functions, methods and static methods. They also use string (i.e., `'strtolower'`) and array (i.e. `[X::class, 'methodName']`, or `[$object, 'methodName']` ) syntax. In fact, anything that is_callable() may be used. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $array = ['Damien', 'Dan', 'Daniel', 'Davey', 'David', 'Dennis', 'Derick', 'Dmitry', 'Dustin',];
   $array = array_map('strtolower', $array);
   
   //['damien', 'dan', 'daniel', 'davey', 'david', 'dennis', 'derick', 'dmitry', 'dustin',];

.. _case:

Case
----

Case is a PHP keyword, which may be used in three distinct situations: 

+ with switch() expression
+ with match() expression
+ with enumeration

case is often complemented with default.

   <?php
   
   enum Suit
   {
       case Hearts;
       case Diamonds;

.. _cast:

Cast Operator
-------------

Cast operators change the type of the variable to the desired type. Conversion between the current format and the target format may happen. 

The available casts are:

(int), (integer) - cast to integer
(bool), (boolean) - cast to boolean
(float), (double), (real) - cast to float
(string) - cast to string
(array) - cast to array
(object) - cast to object
(unset) - cast to NULL (Deprecated since PHP 7.2)

There is no operator to convert to a specific class type.

   <?php
   $foo = 10;   // $foo is an integer
   $bar = (boolean) $foo;   // $bar is a boolean

.. _catch:

Catch
-----

Catch is the complement clause of try : it defines which exception is caught. Optionally, it defines which variable holds the exception when it happens (since PHP 8.0).

Multiple catches may be used. They are applied in the order of coding, and the first clause which succeed is the last.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   try {
       callSomeMethod();
   } catch (\SomeException $e) {
       display("Warning");

CGI
---

CGI stands for Common Interface Gateway. It is a protocol, whose specification enables web server to execute programs. CGI is platform independent, and can be used with any programming language.

PHP may be build as a CGI, but also as a webserver module or a CGI server. 

CGI was widely used in the early days of the web, more modern web development approaches, such as server-side scripting have largely replaced CGI in contemporary web development due to performance and security considerations.

.. _exception-chain:

Chaining Exceptions
-------------------

Chaining exception is throwing again a caught exception, with a new type, and with the previous exception. 

To provide the previous exception to a new exception, use the third parameter of the Exception constructor. Also, always provide a third argument to custom exceptions.

The previous exception is available with the `getPrevious()` method of the Exception class.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class myException extends \Exception {
   	function __construct(string $message, $code, \Throwable $exception) {
   		parent::__construct($message, $code, $exception);
   	}
   }
   
   try {
   	doSomething();
   } catch(\Exception $e) {
   	// chaining exception
   	throw new myException('doSomething failed', 0, $e);
   }

.. _class-alias:

Class aliases
-------------

It is possible to make an alias of a class and call it with this new name. It either rely on the `use` expression, preferable at the beginning of the namespace, or the class_alias() function, for dynamic and application-wide aliases. 

`use` expressions are valid only in one file, while class_alias() impacts the whole application, once it is called. class_alias() may also be used with dynamic elements, such as variabless.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   use a as b;
   
   class_alias('a', 'c');
   
   class a {
       function __construct() {
           print __CLASS__;
       }
   }

.. _autoload:

Class Autoloading
-----------------

Autoloading provides a hook to allow the loading of a class, the first PHP requires it. This is a more flexible way to handle the class definitions than the traditional inclusions, which requires good planning.

Autoloading requires each class, trait, interface or enumeration to be stored in a distinct file. This is the most popular way, yet autoloading allows any other strategy of storage, as long as the class may be loaded based only on its name.

Autoloading relies on the spl_autoload_register() function. Prior to PHP 8.0, it was possible to define the  __autoload() method, and this has being deprecated since PHP 7.2.

Autoloading does not work for global constants and functions. Those still require a specific inclusion mechanism.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   spl_autoload_register(function ($class_name) {
       include $class_name . '.php';
   });
   
   $obj  = new MyClass1();
   $obj2 = new MyClass2();

.. _class-constant-visibility:

Class Constants Visibility
--------------------------

Class constant may have a visibility option. This limits their accessibility to the current class, its class hierarchy or any other class. Visibilities for class constants are : private, protected and public. 

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class x {
   	// This class can only be used in x
       private const C1 = 1;
   
   	// This class can only be used in x and y

.. _getter:

Class Getter Method
-------------------

Getters are methods used to access the values of a property. Getters may include some formatting. 

Getters are usually created with a setter method.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class x {
       private $property;
       
       public function getProperty() {
           return $this->property;

.. _class-hoisting:

Class Hoisting
--------------

Class hoisting is a compilation mode where the declaration of functions, classes... are moved before their actual usage.

This allows the usage of functions that are declared later in the code. 

PHP doesn't do class hoisting : it does two passes on the code, and later, triggers the autoload if a class is missing. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
   
   // displays foo
   foo();
   
   function foo() { echo __FUNCTION__; }
   
   ?>

.. _class-invasion:

Class Invasion
--------------

Objects of the same type will have access to each others private and protected members even though they are not the same instances. 

Class invasion doesn't work when running an external closure inside the class.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class X {
       private $p = "abc";
   
       function foo(X $x) {
           echo $x->p;
       }
       
       function set($s) {
           $this->p = $s;
       }
   }
   
   $x1 = new x;
   $x1->set('xyz');
   
   $x2 = nex x;
   $x2->foo($x1);
   // display xyz
   
   ?>

.. _class-operator:

Class Operator
--------------

Class operator is the ``::class``, added to a class, interface, trait or enumeration identifier. It returns the fully qualified name of the class, according to the current code. 

``::class`` is affected by `use` expressions, but not by class_alias(); function. 

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // class operator in action
   // This is an unknown class, so it displays A\B
   echo A\B::class;
   
   // This is an 'use' class, so it displays A\B
   use A\B as D;
   echo D::class;
   
   // class_alias creates a new class, so it is different. 
   class E{}
   class_alias('E', 'F');
   echo F::class;
   
   ?>

.. _setter:

Class Setter Method
-------------------

Setters are methods used to give the values of a property. Setters may apply some filtering and validation before accepting the value.

Setters are usually created with a getter method.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class x {
       private $property;
       
       public function setProperty($value) {

.. _wither:

Class Wither Method
-------------------

With is a prefix, that tells the reader that the getter returns a copy of the object, and not the object itself.  


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class x {
       private A $property;
       
       // getter
       public function getProperty() : A {
           return $this->property;
       }
   
       // wither

.. _class_alias:

class_alias()
-------------

The ``class_alias()`` function creates an alias for a class, interface, enum or trait. Then, the alias may be used in place of the original name anywhere in the application, including in ``use`` expressions. 

In PHP 8.3, class_alias() supports the creation of aliases with native PHP classes. 

class_alias() is also usable on interfaces, enumerations and traits. 

Once created, the objects are of the original class. The alias name doesn't stick to the objects, and it is not possible to know if the object was created as an alias or the original class. The alias may be used with types. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class_alias(stdClass::class, StandardClass::class);
   
   $object = new StandardClass();
   
   // stdClass
   print gettype($object);

.. _class:

Classes
-------

Basic class definitions begin with the keyword class, followed by a class name, followed by a pair of curly braces which enclose the definitions of the properties and methods belonging to the class.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class x {
       const CONSTANT = 1;

Clean Architecture
------------------

Clean Architectue is a programming paradigm, where code is distributed in four layers : framework, interface adapters, application business rules, enterprise business rules. The layers are linked by the Dependency rule.

.. _clone:

Clone
-----

Clone makes a duplicate of an object.

PHP makes a shallow clone : it will only make a copy of the scalars properties, and it will keep the reference to any object untouched. This means that objects are shared between an object and its clone. 

To perform a deep clone, aka to clone an object and its referenced properties, there is the magic method __clone().



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class x { }
   
   // instantiation
   $x = new x;
   
   // cloning
   $y = clone $x;

.. _close-tag:

Close Tag
---------

PHP comands are placed between the PHP tags : ``<?php`` and ``?>``.  The second tag is called the closing tag. 

Closing tag allow to finish a PHP tag, and switch back to non-interpreted code. The text following the closing tag is then display raw, until the next PHP tag. 

When a file online contains PHP code, the closing tag is not ncessary. Its absence even prevents the accidental adding of white space, which create output errors.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   // here, PHP code
   
   // the closing tag
   ?>Here, raw text, always displayed
   <?php

.. _closedgeneratorexception:

ClosedGeneratorException
------------------------

A ``ClosedGeneratorException`` is an exception that occurs when the code tries to perform an operation on a generator that has already been closed. Generators iterates over a set of values without needing to create an array to hold all the values in memory at once.

Once a generator is closed, it cannot be used for further iteration. Any attempt to use methods like next(), send(), or throw() on a closed generator throws a ClosedGeneratorException, to indicate that the generator is no longer available for iteration.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // Code example from Ben Peachey (see external links)
   // Adapted for presentation purposes
   
   class CustomException extends Exception {}
   
   function from() {
       yield 1;
       throw new CustomException();

Closure
-------

Closures are anonymous functions : functions without a name. They are also supported by the eponymous `Closure` class in PHP.

They are close to the arrow-functions. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $closure = function ($a) use ($b) {
       return $a + $b + 1;

.. _closure-binding:

Closure Binding
---------------

A closure acquires values from its context of creation. When the closure is created in a different context that wished, one may rebind the closure to another context.

This is done with the two methods Closure::bind() and Closure::bintTo().


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   class A {
       private static function foo() { return 1;}
   }
   
   $closure = function() {
       // Self is undefined here, since it is not inside a class
       return self::foo();
   };
   
   // Self now defined, and set to A

.. _code-injection:

Code Injection
--------------

A CODE injection is a vulnerability, where external data is used as PHP code.  

In the example below, `$_GET` is directly used in the eval() function. By using a clever string (shown in comment), it is possible to assign the variable, and run the phpinfo() command. 

Among the solutions to mitigate this problem : filter adequately the incoming data; use prepared statements. 

Some PHP functions are sensitive to this kind of attack : eval(), include(), include_once(), require(), require_once(). Dynamic calls are also suceptible of code injection. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
   
   // $_GET['x'] = '1; phpinfo()';
   eval("$myvar = $x;");
   
   // $_GET['method'] = 'getSafe';
   // Any method may be called on the safe object
   $data->$method();
   
   ?>

.. _inventory:

Code Inventory
--------------

A code inventory is the collection of all elements of the same type, for categorized review. 

For example, variable names, error messages, namespaces, regexes are all interesting inventories. 

Inventories work best when the code practice is scattered: exceptions and regexes are usually created where and when needed, and are rarely considered as a common asset. That leads to repetition and deformations.

.. _code-smell:

Code Smell
----------

A code smell refers to any characteristic or symptom in source code that indicates a potential problem or violation of good programming practices. It is a metaphorical term used to describe code that may not be structured optimally or may be prone to bugs, maintainability issues, or other software development problems. Code smells are subjective indicators and do not necessarily indicate a bug or an error in the code, but they highlight areas that may require attention and refactoring.

Long methods, duplicate code are code smells. 

Code smells are not strict rules or errors but rather indicators of areas that may need improvement. Recognizing and addressing code smells early in the development process can lead to cleaner, more maintainable, and bug-free code. Automated code analysis tools and code reviews can be helpful in identifying code smells and promoting better coding practices.

.. _command-bus:

Command Bus
-----------

A command bus is a design pattern used in software development, particularly in the context of Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation). It helps to decouple the sender of a command from its handler, allowing for better separation of concerns and improving the overall architecture of the application.

A command bus works together with commands and command handlers. 

Here's a simplified overview of how a command bus works:

+ The sender (e.g., a controller in a web application) creates a command object and sends it to the command bus.
+ The command bus examines the command object and identifies the appropriate command handler based on the type of the command.
+ The command bus dispatches the command to the identified command handler.
+ The command handler processes the command and performs the required actions (e.g., modifying the database, updating the domain model, etc.).

.. _comment:

Comments
--------

In PHP, comments are used to add explanatory notes or annotations within your code. Comments are not executed by the PHP interpreter; they are purely for documentation purposes, and they help you and others understand the code better. PHP supports two main types of comments:

Single-line comments: These are comments that span only one line. They are typically used for brief explanations or annotations within the code. Single-line comments in PHP can be created using either double slashes (``//``) or a hash symbol (``#``).

Multi-line comments: These are comments that can span multiple lines, allowing for more extensive explanations or commenting out large sections of code. Multi-line comments in PHP are enclosed within ``/*`` and ``*/``.

It's important to note that comments do not affect the execution of the PHP code; they are ignored by the PHP interpreter: in fact, they are removed before execution. Comments are primarily for developers and maintainers of the code to understand its purpose, logic, or any special considerations. Well-documented code with meaningful comments can make it easier for you and others to read, understand, and maintain PHP applications.

Comments may be formalized with a specific syntax, and create automated instruction for other application. For example, phpdoc comments are providing extra information with a specific syntax.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // This is a single-line comment
   $variable = 42; // Assign a value to $variable
   # Another single-line comment
   
       /*
       This is a multi-line comment.
       It can span multiple lines and is often used for
       longer explanations or for commenting out sections of code.

.. _compact-array:

Compact array
-------------

An array is compact if it only uses automated indices, starting with 0. This doesn't really show in PHP code, though performances are better for some operations.

Such array's status may be reached by using array_values() or array_keys() on the array. 

This notion is not related to the compact() function.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $array = [1,2,3];
   
   $notCompact = [1,2,3, 4=>4];

.. _compact:

compact()
---------

compact() is a native PHP function, which creates an array containing variables and their values.

It is the opposite of extract().


.. code-block:: php

   $a = '1';
   $b = '2';
   
   $array = compact('a', 'b');

Comparison
----------

Comparison operators, as their name implies, allow you to compare two values. 

PHP comparisons exists wiht type-juggling, `==`, `<>`, `<=>`, switch() and `!=`, and with type checks, match(), `===` and `!==`. 

Inegalities only exists with type-juggling. 

There are also functions dedicated to comparisons, with specific applications : strcmp(), strcasecmp(), strnatcasecpm(), strcoll(), similar_text(), levensthein(), bccomp(), version_compare(), hash_equals().

.. _compression:

Compression
-----------

Compression is the representation of data in a format that uses less space that the original raw data. 

A compression algorithm must provide a way to compress data, and a way to uncompress it, and give access to the original data.

There are lossless compression, which can provide the exact original data (for text, ...) and lossy compression which degrades the original data (for images, video, ...).

PHP supports compression via zip, rar, zlib, bzip2.

Concatenation
-------------

Concatenation is the PHP feature that appends two strings together, to make a third, longer one.

Concatenation is also achieved with interpolation, inside a string; by calling echo, multiple times or with multiple arguments; by using the join() function.

Concatenation is done with the dot operator.

.. _condition:

Condition
---------

Conditions are an expression that are either true or false. 

They are used in conditional statement, to determine which code to process next. 

There are conditions in conditional statements, such as if(), switch() and match(). There are conditions in loops, to determine if the loop shall continue or not : in for(), do-while() and while().  

Conditions in PHP are expressed with comparisons operators. They are also expressed with raw data, which are converted to boolean, thanks to type-juggling.

.. _conditional-structure:

Conditional Structures
----------------------

Conditional structures are instructions which run different code, based on a condition. 

This includes if-elsif-then, switch(), match(), the ternary operators `? ... :` and `?:` and the Coalesce operator `??`.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   if (!function_exists('foo')) {
       function foo() {
           // doSomething
       }
   }
   
   ?>

.. _conditioned:

Conditioned Structures
----------------------

Conditioned structures are definitions that are placed inside a condition structure. 

For example, it is possible to create a function or a class, only if it doesn't exist. 

classes, traits, interfaces, global constants (with define()), enumerations, functions may be conditioned. 

class constants, properties, methods and cases (for ``enum``) cannot be conditioned.

Conditioned structures adapt the PHP context to external condition. For example, some function may become native after a specific PHP version, and is only redefined for older installation. 

Some structures do not accept condition, such as global constants with `const` keyword (with define() function, it is OK).



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   if (!function_exists('foo')) {
       function foo() {
           // doSomething
       }
   }
   
   ?>

.. _configuration:

Configuration
-------------

Configuration is a set of data that conditions the execution of the program.

Generally, configuration isn' changed during the execution of the program. 

PHP has three location for configuration : php.ini, .htaccess and usage of the ini_set() functions. 

Each item of configuration is called a directive.


`Documentation <https://www.php.net/manual/en/configuration.php>`__

.. _const:

Const
-----

``const`` is a PHP keyword, that introduces constant definitions. 

``const`` is allowed inside classes, interfaces, enumerations and traits, to create static constants. ``const`` is also allowed in the global scope, to create global constants. 

``const`` is only allowed in the body of a classes, interfaces, enumerations and traits, and the first level of a main file. It is not possible to create conditioned constants with a if-then structure and const : this requires an include. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php if ($a == 5): ?>
   A is equal to 5
   <?php endif; ?>

.. _constant-scalar-expression:

Constant Scalar Expression
--------------------------

A constant scalar expression is an expression that can be evaluated at compile time and consists only of scalar values (constants), operators. Constant scalar expressions are used to initialize constants, and default values for parameters and properties.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   const A = 1;
   const B = A + 10;
   
   ?>

.. _constant:
.. _global-constant:

Constants
---------

Constants are named values, that never change.  

Constants may be created with the const keyword or the define() function. They may be tested for existence with the defined() function.

There are global constants, which are accessible with their name and their namespaces. There are also constants in classes, interfaces, enums and traits. Those are called class constant.

Constants are namespace dependant. They can be imported using the ``use`` command. 

Constants are usually written in uppercase. 

Global constants used to be case insensitive, when created with define. This feature was removed in PHP 8. Nowadays, both ``const`` and ``define`` create case insensitive values.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   const A = 1;
   define('B', 2);
   
   // displays 1
   echo A;
   
   ?>

.. _constructor:

constructor
-----------

The constructor is a special method in a class, which is called at instantiation of an object, with the provided arguments. 

In PHP, parents constructors are not automatically called, when a child class defines a constructor. They have to be called manually.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class X {
       private $property;
       
       function __construct($value) {
           $this->property = $value;
       }

.. _continue:

Continue
--------

continue is used within looping structures to skip the rest of the current loop iteration and resume the execution at the condition evaluation and then the beginning of the next iteration.

continue is not possible inside a switch structure. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   foreach ($arr as $key => $value) {
       if (!($key % 2)) { // skip even members
           continue;
       }

.. _ci:

Continuous Integration
----------------------

Continuous integration refers to the automation of the build and test phase of development. 

Every revision that is committed triggers an automated build and test. With continuous delivery, code changes are automatically tested, reviewed, and built for a release to production.

Since a lot of these operations a executed one after the other, they are called a pipeline. 

Continuous integration is a building block for continuous delivery. This extended notion also include the automated release in production of the code.

Contravariance
--------------

Contravariance allows a parameter type to be less specific in a child method, than that of its parent. 

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class v {}
   
   class w extends v {
       // This method accepts an object compatible with w, but less specific
       function foo(v $arg) { }
   }
   
   class wv extends w {

.. _control-flow:

Control Flow
------------

Control flow structures direct the way PHP execute the statements. For example, a loop repeats the same statements several times; a goto instruction jumps to another part of the code; a if-then statement applies a block of code or another, depending on a condition.

+ if
+ else
+ elseif/else if
+ Alternative syntax for control structures
+ while
+ do...while
+ for
+ foreach
+ break
+ continue
+ switch
+ match
+ declare
+ return
+ require()
+ include()
+ require_once()
+ include_once()
+ goto

Control flow structures can't be called dynamically : they have to be hardcoded, or nested in a closure or other function. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
   
   if ($a === 1) { 
   	$b = 2;
   } else {
   	$b = 3;

.. _control-structure:

Control Structures
------------------

Control structures are PHP statements that control the flow of execution. 

+ if / elseif / else if
+ while
+ do-while
+ for
+ foreach
+ break
+ continue
+ switch
+ match
+ declare
+ return
+ require()
+ include()
+ require_once()
+ include_once()
+ goto

Usually, instructions and commands are executed one after each other. With control structures, this flow is changed and the execution will go to another part of the code for its next step. For example, inside a loop, when PHP encounters a break command, it will then execute the next command after the loop, instead of the next command sequentially.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   if (rand(0, 1) > 0) {
       print 'Hello, world.';
   } else {
       print 'World : hello!';

.. _convention:

Convention
----------

A convention is a way in which something is usually done.

.. _countable:

Countable Interface
-------------------

The Countable interface in PHP is a built-in interface that allows objects to be counted using the count() function. 

By implementing the Countable interface, a class can define custom logic for determining its count.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   class Collection implements Countable
   {
       private $list = [];
       
       public function add($x) {

.. _coupling:

Coupling
--------

Coupling refers to the degree of dependency between different classes of a software. It measures how interconnected or interdependent these classes are. There are several types of coupling, ranging from loose (good) to tight (undesirable). 

    Content Coupling: This is the strongest form of coupling, where one module directly accesses or modifies the internal data or methods of another class. It's considered the most undesirable type of coupling, as it makes the modules highly dependent on each other and difficult to change independently.

    Common Coupling: In this type, multiple modules share the same data or a common storage location. Changes to this shared data can impact multiple modules simultaneously, leading to potential issues in understanding and maintaining the codebase.

    External Coupling: This type of coupling occurs when two modules rely on the same external interface, such as a file, a database, or a communication protocol. Changes to the external interface can affect multiple modules, but at least the internal details remain separate.

    Control Coupling: Control coupling happens when one module passes control information (e.g., flags, status, or control variables) to another module. The receiving module behaves differently based on this information, introducing dependencies between them.

    Data Coupling: Data coupling is a better form of coupling compared to the above ones. It happens when two modules share data through parameters or arguments, but they do not directly access each other's internal data. It promotes encapsulation and makes it easier to maintain and understand the system.

    Message Coupling: In this type, modules communicate by passing messages, which can be in the form of method calls, function calls, or events. The modules don't need to know each other's internal details, and they interact based on well-defined interfaces.

    No Coupling (or Content Independence): The ideal type of coupling is no coupling at all, where modules are entirely independent of each other. Each module operates in isolation, and changes to one module do not affect others.

Software designers aim to achieve low coupling and high cohesion (a measure of how closely the elements within a module are related) in their systems to improve maintainability, reusability, and overall system design.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // User class with high coupling (Content Coupling)
   class User {
       private $username;
       private $email;
   
       public function __construct($username, $email) {
           $this->username = $username;
           $this->email = $email;
       }
   
       // Content coupling: EmailSender is directly accessed here
       public function register() {
           // Register the user in the database
   
           // Send a welcome email
           $emailSender = new EmailSender();
           $emailSender->sendWelcomeEmail($this->username, $this->email);

CSV injection
-------------

A CSV injection is a vulnerability, where a csv file triggers the execution of a formula, stored in a cell. Formulas in cells starts usually with `=`, and may also use `+`, `-`, `@`, tabulation and carriage return.

Depending on the opening spreadsheet software, various targets may be achieved, ranging from sending local data to a remote server, to take over the computer. 

CSV injections rarely target PHP itself, as it is not a spreadsheet, nor support formulas in CSV files. Also, components such as `PHPspreadsheet` are able to run a wide range of formulas. 

PHP may relay an injection by saving it in a CSV file.

A feature is called 'custom' when it is not part of the standard installation of PHP, any PHP extension or a publish library. For example, the function foo() is generally a custom function.

Any declaration object may be custom : constants, variables, classes, interfaces, enums, traits. 

A custom asset is usually the last to be defined, and, as such, has to use a distinct name. For example, declaring a function called ``wp_header`` is possible as long as the code is not part of Wordpress, which does declare it as a common set of features.

.. _dangling-reference:

Dangling Reference
------------------

In a foreach loop, a variable is used for looping through the array. When this variable is configured as a reference, the reference survives after the end of the loop. When this variable is reused later, it applies to the last element of the array and overwrites its value.

This doesn't happen when the second loop doesn't use a reference. 

It is recommended to unset the referenced variable, after the loop. It destroys the reference, not the value.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $array = ['a', 'b', 'c'];

.. _dsn:

Data Source Name (DSN)
----------------------

A DSN is a string that describes a database location and access. 

The format of a DSN is usually specified by the target database. For example : 

+ MySQL: 'mysql:host=localhost;dbname=test'
+ Oracle: 'oci:dbname=//localhost:1521/mydb'
+ PostGreSQL: 'pgsql:host=localhost;port=5432;dbname=testdb;user=bruce;password=mypass'
+ SQLite: 'sqlite:/opt/databases/mydb.sq3'

DSN is closely related to the PDO extension.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   $dbh = new PDO('mysql:host=localhost;dbname=test', $user, $pass);
   ?>
   


`Documentation <https://www.php.net/manual/en/pdo.connections.php>`__

.. _database:

Database
--------

A database is an organized set of data, which may be queried.

The database differs from the dataset by the query mechanism. 

The database may be managed by a server, though it is not necessary.


`Documentation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database>`__

.. _dbal:

Database Abstraction Layer (DBAL)
---------------------------------

A Database Abstraction Layer provides one unique interface to build, and execute queries on different databases.

.. _dataset:

Dataset
-------

A dataset is an organized collection of data.

The data may be structured or not. The dataset needs a programming language to query it, or will be imported in a database for further processing.


`Documentation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set>`__

.. _date:
.. _datetime:

Dates
-----

These functions allow you to get the date and time from the server where your PHP scripts are running. You can use these functions to format the date and time in many different ways.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   $dt = new DateTimeImmutable('2015-11-01 00:00:00', new DateTimeZone('America/New_York'));
   echo 'Start: ', $dt->format('Y-m-d H:i:s P'), PHP_EOL;
   $dt = $dt->add(new DateInterval('PT3H'));
   echo 'End:   ', $dt->format('Y-m-d H:i:s P'), PHP_EOL;

.. _datetime-trap:

Datetime Trap
-------------

When using Datetime objects, be aware that methods that returns the modified date is actually returning the object itself. This means that calculating a difference with ``diff()``, ``add()``, ``modify()`` methods also changes the underlying object. 

This trap is also set in packages that are build on top of Datetime. 

To avoid this trap, use the DatetimeImmutable class. This class is not modified by those methods, but returns a new object each time.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $today = new Datetime('now');
   print $today->format('d-m-Y').PHP_EOL;
   // 24-11-2023
   
   $tomorrow = $today->add(new DateInterval('P1D'));
   print $tomorrow->format('d-m-Y').PHP_EOL;
   // 25-11-2023 (as expected)
   
   $twoDaysLater = $today->add(new DateInterval('P2D'));
   print $twoDaysLater->format('d-m-Y');
   // 27-11-2023 (one day overshoot!)
   
   ?>

.. _day-in-seconds:

Day Are Not 86400 Seconds
-------------------------

Days in seconds is a classic bug when dealing with dates. It happens when adding 86400 seconds to a time to get the same time on the next day. 

The bug will happen most commonly twice a year, at the change of time from winter to summer time. Those days are one hour longer or shorter and lead to calculating the wrong time on the next day. 

Thig bug may also have impact when the internal clock of the server is updated, or when extra leap seconds are added, by December 31st or June 30th (it depends on the years).

When dealing with days, it is recommended to use an interval, or use reltive expression like 'tomorrow'.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $tomorrow = new DateTime('tomorrow');
   $secondsLeft = $tomorrow->getTimestamp() - time();
   echo $secondsLeft;
   
   ?>

.. _days-in-month:

Days In Month
-------------

Days in month is a classic bug when dealing with dates. It happens when adding a month to a date and ending on two months later. 

This happens when adding a month to the last day of a month, while this month is longer than the next. For example, January 31st, or Halloween October 31st. After adding a month, PHP calculates it as the November 31st, which doesn't exists. Yet, PHP converts it to December 1st.

When dealing with months, it is recommended to use expressions like 'first day of this month', or 'next month', instead of adding a month to an existing date.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   echo date('d-m-Y', strtotime("+1 months", strtotime('31 October 2000')));
   
   echo (new DateTime('first day of this month'))->format('jS, F Y');
   echo (new DateTime('next month'))->format('jS, F Y');
   
   ?>

.. _dead-code:
.. _unused-code:

Dead code
---------

Dead code refers to sections of code that are no longer executed or reachable during the program's execution. It includes any lines or blocks of code that do not contribute to the program's functionality or produce any observable results. Dead code can be the result of code modifications, changes in requirements, or mistakes during development.

Dead code is also known as unused code. It happens to any defined structure. Variables, methods, functions, classes, interfaces, etc..

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // bar is dead code : never executed
   function bar() { echo "World"; }
   
   // foo() is alive code : it is executed
   function foo() { echo "Hello"; }
   
   echo foo();

Debugger
--------

A debugger is an extension or an external program that is used to help when searching for bugs in PHP code. 

There are several debuggers in PHP : Interactive PHP Debugger, xdebug, kint, krumo, whoops, PHP. 

Debugging include executing the code step by step, displaying and modifying the content of variables. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
   	// simple debug system with native PHP print_r
   	print_r($_GET);

.. _declare-encoding:

declare encoding
----------------

declare() with encoding specifies the encoding of the file that holds PHP script. This applies to the current file only. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
       declare(encoding='UTF-8');
   ?>

.. _declare:

declare()
---------

declare() is a language construct. It is used to set execution directives for a block of code. 

declare() may set the following values : 

+ ``strict_types`` : strict typing in the block
+ ``ticks`` : generate a tick event 
+ ``encoding`` : per-file encoding directive

declare() affects some configuration for the next block of code. 


.. code-block:: php

.. _decorator:
.. _decoration:

Decorator Pattern
-----------------

A decorator is a design pattern used to add behavior or responsibilities to objects dynamically, without altering their code. Decorators are often used to extend the functionality of classes or objects by wrapping them in additional classes that provide the desired functionality.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   interface Coffee {
       function cost();
   }
   
   class SimpleCoffee implements Coffee {
       public function cost() {
           return 5;
       }
   }
   
   class MilkDecorator implements Coffee {
       protected $coffee;
   
       public function __construct(Coffee $coffee) {

.. _deep-clone:

Deep Clone
----------

A deep clone is an object cloning, where the cloned object also clone its own object properties. This prevents the original object to share data with the cloned one, yet it is slower to process.

Deep cloning is achieved by using the ``__clone`` magic method. By default, PHP does shallow clone.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class Dog {
       private $name = '';
       private Address $address;
   
       function __construct(string $name, Address $address) {
           $this->address->setName($address);
       }
       
       function moves(string $address) {

   }
   
   $spike = new Dog('Spike', new Address('Acme city'));
   $medor = clone $spike;
   $medor->moves('Upstate farm');

.. _default:

Default
-------

default is a PHP keyword, used with switch() and match() structures. It represents any case that was not already considered.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   switch ($i) {
       case 0:
           echo "i equals 0";
           break;
       case 1:
           echo "i equals 1";
           break;
       default 2:
           echo "i is not 0 nor 1";
           break;
   }
   
   ?>

Related : :ref:`Switch <switch>`, :ref:`Match <match>`, :ref:`Case <case>`

.. _default-parameter:

Default Parameter
-----------------

Methods may define a default value for parameters. That way the parameter may be omitted during the call, and this value will be used. 

The default value may be a static expression, and, since PHP 8.1, also include new expression. 

The default parameter must be the last of the parameters : adding a parameter without default value after one will yield an error and mess up the call parameters.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   function makeCodffe($type = 'latte') {
       return "Making a cup of $latte";
   }
   
   ?>

.. _default-value:

Default Value
-------------

Default value is the value that a parameter or a property takes when it is used for the first time, and have not been provided. 

Arguments and properties may have a default value. That way, arguments may be skipped when the method is being called, and the properties do not have to be initialized before usage.

Variable have a default value of null. Their initial assignement is considered a default value, as it replaces the `null` one. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   function foo($a = 1) {
       echo $a;
   }
   
   foo('one ');
   foo();

.. _define:

define()
--------

define() is a PHP function, that introduces constant definitions. 

define() is a function, and may be called anywhere. It is slower than `const`, as it is only executed at runtime. define() doesn't allow class constants creation.

define() used to create case-insensitive constant, but this was abandoned in PHP 7.3.



.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
       define('HELLO', 'Hello');

.. _dereferencing:

Dereferencing
-------------

Dereferencing is the action to access a value, which is referenced with a pointer. Since PHP has no pointer, dereferencing applies to accessing an element in an array or an object. 

Dereferencing is also possible to function and methods calls : when a function returns an array or an object, it is possible to immediately access one of the element by using the array or method syntax.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $array = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
   
   echo $array['b'];
   
   function foo() {

Design by Contract
------------------

Design by Contract (DbC) is a software development approach that focuses on specifying the expected behavior of software components through preconditions, postconditions, and invariants. Although DbC is not natively supported in PHP, you can incorporate its principles into your PHP code using libraries and coding practices.

A design pattern, or simply a pattern, is a general solution to a common problem. Design patterns also get a name, for easy reference. 

Common design patterns in PHP (this list is not exhaustive) : 
+ Factory
+ Dependency injection
+ Decorator
+ Module
+ Iterators

Design patterns are not dedicated to PHP, though most of them do apply to PHP.

.. _wrapper-designpattern:

Design Pattern Wrapper
----------------------

A wrapper is also a design pattern, also called an adaptor. This concept also appears when a component provide access to a remote service : it is a PHP wrapper (wrapper for the service when calling PHP) or a `service-name` wrapper, when it is viewed from PHP.

.. _destructor:

Destructor
----------

The destructor is a special method in a class, which is called at shutdown of an object, in order to do any last minute cleaning. 

Most of the time, the destructor is automatic : removing scalar values may be sufficient. In cases of resources, or other objects, it is recommended to issue the graceful commands to shut them down in turn. 

Destructors are usually called after the end of the script, and will not have access to any display. As such, calls to echo are ineffective.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class X {
       private $file;
   
       function __construct($path) {
           $this->file = fopen($path, 'w');
       }
       
       function __destruct() {
           fwrite($this->file, "End");
           fclose($this->file);

.. _directives:

Directives
----------

Directives are the configuration option of PHP. They may be set in the ``php.ini`` file, in HTTP server files like ``.htaccess``, or accessed via the ini_get() and ini_set() native calls. 

Directives are also set by PHP extensions or by PHP applications.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   echo 'display_errors = ' . ini_get('display_errors') . "\n";
   echo 'register_globals = ' . ini_get('register_globals') . "\n";

   <?php
   $iterator = new DirectoryIterator(__DIR__);
   while($iterator->valid()) {
       $file = $iterator->current();

.. _dirname:

dirname
-------

Dirname is the name of the path to a file. 

In `/var/www/index.php`, the dirname is `/var/www`.

In PHP, dirname() provides the dirname from a path, based on the `/` separator. It has to be combined with basename() to get the name of the directory, without its path.

.. _disable_classes:

Disable classes
---------------

This directive disables the provided list of classes in the `php.ini`.

Once disabled, the classes may be created, via an extension or in the code of PHP. Custom classes may still be created and used. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   // in php.ini
   
   disable_classes="mysqli,socket,soapserver"

.. _disable-functions:

Disable Functions
-----------------

This PHP directive is used to prevent specific functions from being called in PHP scripts. It helps mitigate potential security vulnerabilities or enforce practices by forbidding usage of specific functions.

This directive requires a list of PHP functions, separated by a comma, and set in the PHP.ini file : this is read at startup time and cannot be changed later. 

disable_functions only works on PHP native functions. It is not possible to preemptively disable a custom function. 

Disabled functions appear as undefined : in fact, they can also be redefined, with a custom code and then used. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   // in php.ini
   
   disable_functions="print_r,phpinfo,var_dump"

.. _dnf:
.. _dnf-type:

Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF)
-----------------------------

DNF stands for 'Disjunctive Normal Form'. It is a standard form used in propositional logic and Boolean algebra. DNF represents logical expressions as a disjunction (OR) of one or more conjunctions (AND) of literals. In simpler terms, it is a way to express logical statements using only the logical operators "OR" and "AND".

The DNF form allows for the representation of any logical expression using a combination of OR and AND operators. It is particularly useful in logic analysis, theorem proving, and boolean circuit design.

.. _divisionbyzeroerror:

DivisionByZeroError
-------------------

DivisionByZeroError is thrown when an attempt is made to divide a number by zero. It is never possible to divide by zero, the result is undefined. It is true for all zeroes: 0, +0, -0. 

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   try {
       echo 1/$a;
   }
   catch(DivisionByZeroError $e){
       echo "Trying to divide by 0";
   }
   ?>

.. _do-while:

Do While
--------

Do While is a loop structure. It runs the block of code until the condition is not met anymore. The block is run once before the condition is checked, so it is always run at least once.

Part of the block execution may be skipped by using the `continue` keyword. 

 

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   /*
   do {
   	// the block
   } while(condition);
   */
   
   $i = 1;
   do {

.. _domxml:

DOM
---

The DOM extension in PHP is an extension that allows developers to work with XML documents using the Document Object Model (DOM) API. It provides a set of classes and functions to parse, manipulate, and generate XML documents.

The DOM extension provides a tree-based representation of an XML document, where each element, attribute, and text node is represented as an object. This allows developers to traverse and manipulate the XML document easily.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // from PHP manual : https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.domcomment.php
   
      $xml = new DOMDocument();
       $xml->loadXML('<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
         <configuration version="2">
         <!-- test &#45;&#45;&gt; -->
         test &#45;&#45;&gt;
         </configuration>'
       );
   $xpath = new DOMXPath($xml);
   $comments = $xpath->query('//comment()');
   $elements = $xpath->query('//configuration');
   
   echo $comments[0]->textContent;
   // result: test &#45;&#45;&gt;

.. _domainexception:

DomainException
---------------

Exception thrown if a value does not adhere to a defined valid data domain. For example, it might be an invalid value for a class property and not just its type.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   function renderImage($imageResource, $imageType)
   {
     switch ($imageType) {

.. _double-quote:

Double Quotes Strings
---------------------

Double quoted strings are strings that include variables (properties and arrays), which are interpolated at execution time.

This is an extended version of the single-quoted strings.

.. _dry:

DRY : don't repeat yourself
---------------------------

"Don't repeat yourself" (DRY) is a principle of software development aimed at reducing repetition of software patterns.

The concept was coined in Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas's book The Pragmatic Programmer, in 1999.

`Documentation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself>`__

.. _dto:

DTO
---

DTO stands for Data Transfer Object : it is an object that carries data between methods. 

DTO is a class, and replaces arrays advantageously : it has declared properties, with specified names. It may be used for typing, and hold methods. 



`Documentation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transfer_object>`__

.. _ducktyping:

Duck Typing
-----------

In duck typing, an object is of a given type if it has all methods and properties required by that type.

.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
   
   interface i {
   	function foo() ; 
   }
   
   // class X doesn't implement i, yet it is of type i because it implements foo()
   class X {
   	function foo() {}
   	function bar() {}

.. _dynamic-call:

Dynamic Call
------------

A dynamic call happens when part of the syntax comes from a variable, and is not known at code writing time.

In PHP, every syntax may use a dynamic call.



.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
   
   $constant = "Name";
   echo constant($constant); 
   echo constant("someClass::$constant"); 
   
   $variable = 'a';
   $a = 'b';
   echo $$variable; // b
   
   $function = 'mine';
   $function($arg);
   
   $className = '\stdclass';
   new $className;
   
   $method = 'method';
   $object->$method();
   
   echo $object::CONSTANT;
   
   ?>

See also `All the Dynamic Syntaxes in PHP <https://www.exakat.io/en/all-the-dynamic-syntaxes-in-php/>`_

.. _dynamic-class:

Dynamic Class
-------------

A dynamic class is a class whose fully qualified name is defined at execution time. 

This is convenient for module systems, where the actual class is named from an external configuration.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class AB {}
   
   class AC {}
   
   $name = '\A'.(rand(0, 1) ? 'B' : 'C');
   
   $object = new $name;
   
   ?>


Related : :ref:`new <new>`

.. _dynamic-constant:

Dynamic Constant
----------------

A constant is dynamic when its name is a piece of data, and is only access at execution time. 

Calling a constant is done by using the constant() function. 

Sometimes, dynamic constants are also called variable constants. 

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   const A = 1;
   
   $a = 'A';
   
   echo constant($a); // displays 1
   
   ?>

Related : :ref:`Constants <constant>`

.. _dynamic-loading:

Dynamic Loading
---------------

Dynamic Loading is related to the loading of PHP extensions, at execution time. 

Most of the time, the extensions are compiled with PHP, and loaded at startup. For development purposes, or for distribution purposes, some libraries may be loaded at execution time, with the dl() function.

Dl() calls are considered bad for performances and for security. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
       // add extra features to PHP
       dl('ldap.so');
   ?>
   


`Documentation <https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.dl.php>`__

.. _dynamic-property:

Dynamic Properties
------------------

Dynamic properties are properties created on the fly, without previous definition. 

When the class implements the magic methods __get() and __set(), of if the class extends stdclass, then no warning is emitted.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class X {
       private $property = 1;
       
       function foo() {
           // dynamic property
           $this->a = 1;
           
           // dynamic property with variable name 
           $b = "abc";
           $this->$b = 1; 
           
           // static property
           $this->property = 1;

.. _dynamic-variable:

Dynamic Variable
----------------

A dynamic variable is a variable whose name stored in a variable or an expression. 

They are identified by a double $ sign, though the same operator may be used multiple times. 

They are also called variable variable. 

.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
   
   $a = 'b';
   $b = 'c';
   $c = 'd';

.. _echo:

Echo
----

``echo`` is a PHP language construct used to output text to the browser or the output stream. It's commonly used to display content on a web page, generate HTML, or provide feedback to users. The echo construct is often used in PHP scripts to generate dynamic content that is sent to the client's web browser.

echo is a language construct of PHP. 

echo works without parenthesis. It also accepts an arbitrary number of arguments.

Echo Tag
--------

Echo tag is a special PHP opening tag : ``<?=``. It combines the opening tag, and a call to the echo function.

The echo tag should not be confused with PHP short tags ``<?``.

It is also called the short echo tag.

.. _ellipsis:

Ellipsis
--------

Ellipsis operator is the `...` operator. It also bears the name of three dots, and even dot dot dot. 

It is used to implements the array spread feature, and the variadic arguments. The actual feature depends on the context. 

Ellipsis is the classic punctuation description of the operator, and will apply to both features.

Empty
-----

Empty is a language structure, which determines whether a variable is empty. 

A variable is considered empty if it does not exist or if its value equals false. This may overlap with the usage of isset().


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // True
   var_dump(empty($a));
   
   $b = [];
   // True
   var_dump(empty($b));

.. _encoding:

Encoding
--------

Encoding is the way characters are organized to hold a meaning while being transmitted, stored or manipulated. 

Encoding applies to PHP scripts, which should be UTF-8 encoded, although it might support other formats.

Encoding applies to incoming and outgoing data.

Encoding operations are provided with mb_string, ``iconv`` and ``intl`` extensions. 

Encoding is also used for code : the source is encoded when it is transformed in an unreadable yet still executable form. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   $text = "This is the Euro symbol '€'.";
   
   echo 'Original : ', $text, PHP_EOL;
   echo 'TRANSLIT : ', iconv("UTF-8", "ISO-8859-1//TRANSLIT", $text), PHP_EOL;
   echo 'IGNORE   : ', iconv("UTF-8", "ISO-8859-1//IGNORE", $text), PHP_EOL;

.. _environment-variable:

Environment Variables
---------------------

Environment variables are a way to store and access configuration information or settings related to the runtime environment in which a PHP script is executed. These variables are part of the operating system's environment and can be used to retrieve information about the server, the operating system, or custom configuration parameters that are set for a particular application. PHP provides a way to access these variables through the ``$_ENV`` superglobal array.

The environment variables are set in the operating system before the execution of the script, using commands such as `export`, `setenv`, or else (depending on the OS). They may also be provided at the start of containerized images. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // print all available environment variables at the start of the script
   // it may be empty
   print_r($_ENV);
   
   // retrieve an environment variable 
   var_dump(getenv('MY_VARIABLE'));
   
   // sets an environment variable 
   var_dump(setenv('MY_VARIABLE', 2));

.. _error:

Error
-----

The `Error` class is a base class for all internal PHP error exceptions. It represents an error that occurs during the execution of PHP code. The Error class extends the built-in Throwable interface, making it possible to catch and handle these error exceptions using try-catch blocks.

The Error class has several child classes that represent specific types of errors. Some common child classes include:

+ ParseError: Represents a syntax error that occurs during parsing of PHP code.
+ TypeError: Represents a type-related error, such as passing an incorrect argument type to a function or method.
+ DivisionByZeroError: Represents an error that occurs when dividing a number by zero.
+ OutOfMemoryError: Represents an error that occurs when the PHP process runs out of memory.

Here's an example that demonstrates catching and handling a ParseError:

php


In this example, the eval() function is used to evaluate a string of PHP code. However, the code contains a syntax error with a missing semicolon. This results in a ParseError being thrown. We use a try-catch block to catch the ParseError exception, and then display the error message using the getMessage() method.

It's important to note that these error exceptions are only thrown for internal PHP errors. User-generated errors (e.g., triggered using the trigger_error() function) are not instances of the Error class. Instead, they are represented by the ErrorException class, which extends Exception.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   try {
       eval('echo "Hello, World!"'); // Missing semicolon generates a ParseError
   } catch (ParseError $e) {
       echo 'Caught ParseError: ' . $e->getMessage();
   }
   
   ?>

.. _error-handler:

Error Handler
-------------

The PHP error handler is a method that manages errors when they arise, instead of the default PHP handler. 

The error handler is set with the set_error_handler() function. 

The error handler is convenient to translate errors, handle custom levels of errors, or convert errors to exceptions. 

There is a separate exception handler. 

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   set_error_handler('customErrorHandler');
   
   function customErrorHandler($errno, $errstr, $errfile, $errline, array $errcontext)
   {
   	// Handles @ error suppression
   	if (error_reporting === 0)
   	{
   		return false;
   	}
   
   	throw new Exception($errstr, 0, $errno, $errfile, $errline);
   }
   ?>

.. _error-reporting:

Error Reporting
---------------

Error reporting is both a feature, a directive and a PHP native function. They all work with the same concept.

Error reporting is the way PHP display errors are they are detected during execution. The error_reporting() function and the error_reporting directive sets the type of error to be reported : errors are of different types (Warning, Notice, Error, etc.)

While error reporting sets the type of reported error, the display of error is handled by different directives : display_errors and html_errors.

Exceptions are not covered by the error reporting, even though one of the exception is called Error.

Error reporting may be further configured with an error handler function. 

Error may be trigger manually with the trigger_error() function.

.. _escape-character:

Escape Character
----------------

Escape characters are special characters, that introduce a special meaning, for example when redacting an escape sequence.

Escape characters are often generating a special sequence to escape themselves and allow their literal meaning to be expressed.

In PHP's strings and HEREDOC, the escape character is the backslash : "\".



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   echo "<a href="https://www.exakat.io/" />";
   
   ?>

.. _escape-data:

Escape Data
-----------

Escaping data is a method to write data in a neutral syntax for a target technology. 

For example, angular brackets and quotes are special characters for HTML : to display them without their actual HTML meaning, they have to be escaped as HTML entities, such as &quote or &gt;. 

Escaping applies to technologies which mix raw strings and executable expression : SQL, CSV, HTML, LDAP, etc. 

Escaping data replace some symbols with a longer sequence of symbols. The escaping is made with a special character, which must itself be escaped. For example, CSV escapes anti-slash with a double anti-slash.

PHP supports escape sequences for characters in a string. This is the same concept of escaping data : there, the target includes portability.



`Documentation <https://owasp-top-10-proactive-controls-2018.readthedocs.io/en/latest/c4-encode-escape-data.html>`__

.. _escape-sequence:

Escape Sequences
----------------

Escape sequences are sequences of characters with a special meaning. Most of the time, the literal value of the character displayed is its meaning, while, sometimes, there are other hidden meaning.

An escape sequence is dedicated to a technology, and they are rare the same between two technologies, or even, between two engines dedicated to that technology.

Examples of escape sequences ; 

PHP, in strings: 
  + \n (new line)
  + \t (horizontal tabulation)
  + "  (double quote, inside a double quoted-string)
  + "  This is not an escape sequence : single quoted string do not recognize this
  + \u{01f418} : a unicode codepoint, representing an elephpant
  + \200 : a character in octal notation
  + \x69 : a character in hexadecimal notation

HTML : 
 + &acute; (a acute accent)
 + &quote; (double quote)

Escape sequences should not be confused with escape characters, though they are related : some escape sequences are introduced by an escape character. Others rely on a format. 
 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // \1 is an escape sequence that represents the first capturing parenthsis. 
   // It is a special meaning for REGEX.
   preg_match('/(.)\1/', $string);
   
   // Displays AA
   echo "A\101";
   
   ?>

The eval() function executes a string as a PHP code.

eval() has been used originally to obtain features that PHP did not offer. Nowadays, those features are rare enough that it is recommended to find a safe alternative, before relying on it.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $name = 'v';
   $value = 'vvvv';
   
   // Set a variable with a dynamic name
   eval('$'.$name.' = "'.$value.'"');
   // equivalent to $$name = $value;
   
   ?>

.. _event-driven:

Event driven
------------

Event-driven programming is a programming paradigm that focuses on the flow of a program's execution being determined by events or actions that occur, rather than following a strictly sequential, procedural path. In event-driven programming, the program responds to events generated by external factors, such as user interactions, sensor inputs, or messages from other software components. Events can trigger specific functions or pieces of code to execute in response.

.. _exception:

Exception
---------

Exceptions are a mechanism for handling errors and exceptional situations in a more structured and controlled way compared to traditional error handling methods like using error codes or die() statements. Exceptions provide a way to separate the normal flow of code from error-handling code, making it easier to manage errors and maintain clean and readable code.

Exceptions are thrown at the point of detection of the issue, and processed somewhere else in the code, when they are caught by a try-catch statement. Ultimately, exceptions block the execution of the application when they are not caught.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class x {
       final const X = 1;
       
       final function method() { }
   }
   
   ?>

.. _exception-handler:

Exception Handler
-----------------

The exception handler is a default or custom function, which is called once an exception has exhausted all available try-catch blocks.

The execution stops once the handler has been called : as such, it is possible to log or display information related to debugging. 

The exception handler is different from the try/catch block : the latter allows the execution to carry on, when the exception is processed.



.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
   function exception_handler(Throwable $exception) {
     echo "Uncaught exception: " , $exception->getMessage(), "\n";
   }
   
   set_exception_handler('exception_handler');
   
   throw new Exception('Uncaught Exception');
   echo "Not Executed\n";

.. _exponent:
.. _**:

Exponent
--------

Exponent is the mathematical operation to raise a number to the power of another number. 

There are two possibilities to use this operation : the `**` operator, and the pow() function.  



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   echo pow(-3, 2); // displays 9 
   
   echo 2 ** 3;    // displays 8
   ?>

.. _exponential:
.. _exp:

Exponential
-----------

The exponential is a mathematical function. It satisfies the equalities : `exp($a + $a) = exp($a) * exp($b)`, and `exp(0) === 1`.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $e = exp(1); // also known as M_E
   
   ?>


`Documentation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_function>`__

Added in PHP 8.1

.. _extends:

extends
-------

`extends` is an operator of the class inheritance. It indicates that a class is built from another one, or an interface is built from another interface. As such, the properties, constants and methods of the parent class or interface are available to the newly created class, unless when they are marked with `private` visibility. 

`extends` is optional. 

`extends` is unique with a class : it is not possible to extends several classes at the same time. 

`extends` may be multiple with interfaces.

`extends` has a different mechanism than `implements` : `implements` provide method signature but no implementation; `extends` provides both. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class x {
   	function foo() { echo "X"; }
   }
   
   class y extends x { }
   
   // Both methods are possible 
   (new x)->foo();
   (new y)->foo();
   
   ?>

.. _extract:

extract()
---------

extract() is a native PHP function, which creates arrays from an array containing variables and their values.

extract() has option to handle situations where the variables are already existing, and how those conflicts should be handled : by default, it overwrites the local variables.

Options are :  ``EXTR_OVERWRITE``, ``EXTR_SKIP``, ``EXTR_PREFIX_SAME``, ``EXTR_PREFIX_ALL``, ``EXTR_PREFIX_INVALID``, ``EXTR_IF_EXISTS``, ``EXTR_PREFIX_IF_EXISTS``, ``EXTR_REFS``.

This function is the opposite of compact().


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $a = 0; // $a is getting overwritten
   $array = extract(['a' => 1, 'b' => 2]);
   
   echo $a + $b; // 2
   ?>

.. _facade:

Facade
------

A facade provides a simplified interface to a complex library. The facade hides the complexity, and iron out some of the dirty details away from the user. 

Facades tends to ease the initial understanding of the library. Later, it limits expert usage and introduce unexpected behavior in the code. 

The Laravel framework is known for its intensive usage of facades.

.. _false:

False
-----

false has two usages, as PHP keyword : the opposite of true, as a boolean value and a special type for functions that may return a boolean, but not true. 

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   function foo($a) : false|A {
       if ($a == 1) {
           return false;
       } else {
           return new A();

.. _fastcgi:

FastCGI
-------

CGI stands for fast CGI, so fast Common Interface Gateway. It is a protocol, built on top of CGI. Unlike CGI, fastCGI has persistent processes that can handle more than one request before being destroyed. It also implements multiplexing.

PHP may be build as a fast CGI, in the php-fpm demon.

.. _feature:

Feature
-------

A software feature is a specific functionality or capability that is designed and implemented within a software application to provide a specific benefit or serve a particular purpose. Features are the building blocks that make up the overall functionality of a software product, and they are what enable users to perform tasks, achieve goals, or solve problems using the software.

Software features can vary widely depending on the type of application and its intended use. For example, in a word processing software, features might include the ability to format text, insert images, create tables, and perform spell-checks. In a video editing software, features might include cutting, trimming, adding effects, and exporting videos in different formats. In a messaging app, features might include sending text messages, multimedia messages, and voice calls.

Developers prioritize and implement features based on user needs, market demand, and the overall vision for the software. As software evolves, new features may be added to enhance its functionality or to keep up with advancements in technology and user expectations. Additionally, user feedback and requests often play a role in determining which features get added or improved in future updates of the software.

.. _file:

File
----

A file is a named collection of data or information that is stored and organized on a computer's storage system. In computing, files are used to store various types of data, such as text, images, audio, video, programs, and more. Files can be created, accessed, modified, and deleted by computer programs and users.

Files are typically organized into a hierarchical structure called a file system, which helps to manage and organize them. Each file is identified by a unique name, which allows it to be located and accessed within the file system. Files can be stored on different types of storage media, including hard drives, solid-state drives, network storage, and removable storage devices such as USB drives.

A file consists of two main components: the file name and the file content. The file name is used to identify and refer to the file, while the file content contains the actual data stored within the file. The content can vary depending on the type of file, such as plain text, binary data, or specific file formats.

A file is a resource for recording data on a computer storage device, such as a hard drive or memory.

.. _upload:
.. _file-upload:

File Upload
-----------

PHP is able to receive files as part of a form submission. 

PHP is capable of receiving file uploads from any RFC-1867 compliant browser. 

File upload code is based on the $_FILES superglobal, and move_uploaded_file() function. It also relies on several PHP directives :  ``file_uploads``, ``upload_max_filesize``, ``upload_tmp_dir``, ``post_max_size`` and ``max_input_time``. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   $uploaddir = '/var/www/uploads/';
   $uploadfile = $uploaddir . basename($_FILES['userfile']['name']);
   
   echo '<pre>';
   if (move_uploaded_file($_FILES['userfile']['tmp_name'], $uploadfile)) {
       echo 'File is valid, and was successfully uploaded.';
   } else {
       echo 'Possible file upload attack!';

.. _for:

For
---

For is a loop structure. It is configured with an initialization expression, an ending expression and an increment expression. 

The for() loop executes the init expression first, and only once. Then it executes the block, the increment and the ending. When the ending is false, it exits the loop.

The initialization, ending and increment expression may all host several instructions : they have to be separated by comma, rather than semi colons.

Part of the block execution may be skipped by using the `continue` keyword.

.. _foreach:

Foreach
-------

Foreach is the most popular loop in PHP. 

The foreach() loop uses all the elements of the source, and assign them to the blind variable. By default, only the value is assigned; when using the `$key => $value` syntax, the key is also assigned. Then the block is executed with the assigned values. 

Part of the block execution may be skipped by using the `continue` keyword. 

The value may be a reference : then it actually references the original value, which then may be modified in the source. Do not forget to unset referenced variables after the loop, to avoid the dangling reference syndrome, when the last value is changed.

The value may be an array, collecting several values at the same time.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   /*
   foreach($source as $key => $value) {
   	// block
   }

Form
----

A form is a web page component to collect and submit information. 

The form submits the information using HTTP protocol, and the GET or POST method. It is generally processed by the browser.

The form defines variable, whose content is submitted to the PHP script. Those values are accessed with $_GET, $_POST, $_REQUEST.

Form is an HTML element, in a web page. As such, it may be created by PHP, when PHP produces HTML documents.

Format
------

Format is a set of rules to structure a piece of text, and make it parsable by a specific engine. A piece of text may be in the format: then, it is usable as a command for another technology. 

Formats have various shapes. Exemple of formats: 

+ `SQL` Structure Query Language: `SELECT column FROM table` 
+ Date and time (human): `2020-01-01` 
+ sprintf(): `%d 9` 
+ Regular expressions
+ `YAML`
+ INI
+ CSV
+ JSON

It is possible to define one's custom format. Common formats have a comprehensive specifications (how to build them) and assorted tools (encode, decode, use, combine, etc. ).

   <?php
   
   // displays 123 with 9 characters, and fills with dots any empty characters

Framework
---------

A framework is a library of code and practices that helps building PHP applications. Frameworks provide common features, such as forms, authentications, templating, arguments and security. 

Frameworks are often described as a platform : they stand as a layer above PHP, with its own conventions and behaviors. PHP is the language of the framework, and the language used to extends the framework.

.. _garbage-collection:
.. _gc:

Garbage Collection
------------------

Garbage collection is a PHP mechanism that checks memory and frees it when it needs to store new values. 

PHP allocate memory as it needs, when variables and objects are created in the code. Sometimes, those variables are destroyed, using explicit unset() calls, or implicitly, when leaving a method or destroying an object. 

To speed up the process, PHP postpone memory cleaning until the end of the application, or when it reaches some internal threshold. Then, it review all the currently allocated variables, and when they are not used anymore (aka, when the reference counter is down to 0), it removes them.

Since garbage collection requires pausing the execution, PHP only runs it on-demand (via gc_collect_cycles() calls), or once every 10k objects to clear.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // Explicit Garbage Collection 
   gc_collect_cycles();
   
   // implicit garbage collection
   // well,... difficult to illustrate, right?
   
   ?>

Generator
---------

Generators provide an easy way to implement simple iterators without the overhead or complexity of implementing a class that implements the Iterator interface.

Generator must have no return typehint, or use the \Generator typehint.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   function evenIntegers() {
       for ($i = 0; $i < 10; ++$i) {
           yield 2 * $i;

.. _generics:

Generics
--------

Generics are a style of types, where the type of a property, parameter or return is specified at the declaration level. 

The generics syntax looks like : `$users = new List<User>();` where `List` is a class that holds a list of items, and those items are of the type between brackets. Here, it is `User`.

Generics allows the creation of general classes, that can process several types of data. The actual application's type is declared in the type itself. This is similar to configure an array to only handle one type of elements.

Generics have been submitted as RFC since 2016, and are currently not implemented, in the foreseeable future. 

One implementation of generics is available, with transpiling : see ``mrsuh/php-generics``.

git
---

Git is a distributed version control system that is widely used for tracking changes in source code during software development. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 and has since become one of the most popular and essential tools in the software development industry. Git allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project, manage different versions of code, and track changes over time.

.. _glob:

glob()
------

glob() is a function that finds pathnames matching a pattern.

The glob() function is not related to the global keyword.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   foreach (glob("*.txt") as $filename) {
       echo "$filename size " . filesize($filename) . "\n";
   }

.. _global:

global Scope
------------

The global scope is the top level scope. It is the scope when no function, or method scope is active. It is also the first scope when starting execution. 

Variables from the global scope are accessible in other scopes by using the `global` keyword, or the $GLOBALS variable. Variables in the global scope are automatically added to the $GLOBALS variable; in local scopes, the `global` keyword have that effect too.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $x = 'A';
   
   function counter() {
       echo $GLOBALS['A'];
   
   	global $x;

.. _global-variable:

Global Variables
----------------

Variables that reside in the global scope, and may be imported with the global keyword.

To become a global variable, a variable may use one of the following ways : 

+ Be declared as such with the `global` keyword
+ Be created in the `$GLOBALS` variable, which is a global variable itself
+ Be created outside any function, method, closure
+ Be a super-global

Global variables provides a way to share data in different and remote scopes. It also provide a way for data to be modified by another part of the code, without warning.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   
   global $count;
   $count = 0;
   
   function counter() {

.. _goto:

Goto
----

The goto operator PHP is a language construct that allows you to perform an unconditional jump in the flow of your code to a specified label. 

Goto one of the very controversial features in PHP and has been the subject of much debate due to its potential to create spaghetti code and make code difficult to read and maintain.

Some legit uses of goto in PHP include breaking out of nested loops, implementing state machines, or in some cases for error handling. However, they are rare, and should only considered in last resort.

The target label must be within the same file and context, meaning that you cannot jump out of a function or method, nor can you jump into one.


.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
   goto a;
   echo 'Foo';
    
   a:
   echo 'Bar';

.. _hard-coded:

Hard Coded
----------

Hard coded data in code happens when a value is set as a literal in the code, and can't be change through any directives or parameters.

Hard-code becomes a security problem, when the hard-coded value is a password or a hash of it. This secret is now readable in the code.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php 
   
   // This is hard-coded
   $a = 1;
   
   // $b has a default value, but may also be changed at execution time

.. _hash:
.. _hashing:

Hash
----

Hash has several meanings : 

+ PHP extension
+ PHP function
+ a general computer science concept, that transforms data into another value
+ a general computer science concept, that turns a string into another fixed-sized string, in a way that is difficult to revert
+ a synonym for arrays with arbitrary keys, also known as map or associative array

Hash allows direct or incremental processing of arbitrary length messages using a variety of hashing algorithms. 

While the extension 'hash' only process hashes, there are other extensions which offer these features : openssl, sodium and password hashing. Mhash and mcrypt are older PHP extensions, which are now discontinued. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
   
   echo hash('ripemd160', 'The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.');
   // produces ec457d0a974c48d5685a7efa03d137dc8bbde7e3

Hash Comparisons
----------------

Cryptographic hashes are usually represented by strings in PHP. As such, they are subjects to type juggling, and they should be compared with the identity operator, or a dedicated function.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   $expected  = crypt('12345', '$2a$07$usesomesillystringforsalt$');
   $correct   = crypt('12345', '$2a$07$usesomesillystringforsalt$');
   $incorrect = crypt('apple', '$2a$07$usesomesillystringforsalt$');
   
   var_dump(hash_equals($expected, $correct));
   var_dump(hash_equals($expected, $incorrect));

.. _headless:

Headless
--------

A headless website, also known as a headless CMS (Content Management System) or decoupled website, is a web architecture where the frontend and backend are decoupled or separated from each other. In this setup, the frontend (the "head" or user interface) and the backend (the "body" or content management system) operate independently and communicate through APIs (Application Programming Interfaces).

Traditionally, websites are built using a monolithic architecture, where the frontend and backend are tightly integrated. The backend typically handles both content management and presentation logic, rendering HTML pages that are sent to the user's browser.

In contrast, a headless website is designed with a clear separation of concerns.


.. _heredoc:

Heredocs
--------

Heredoc is a string syntax, similar to nowdoc, with internal variable interpolation. They behave like double quoted strings.

The Heredocs syntax uses an arbitrary delimiter. The same delimiter will mark the end of the string.

Heredocs are convenient for large amount of text, that has to be hardcoded. Smaller string will be better suited with double quotes, while even longer text should be processed with a templating system.

It is possible to indent the text in a nowdocs string: to avoid this indentation to be passed at execution time, the final delimiter may be indented too. Its indentation will be removed from the parsed text.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $heredoc = <<<DELIM
   This is a long text.
   
   $variable will not be replaced, and the text stays intact.
   
   DELIM;
   
   $heredoc = <<<DELIM
       This is an indented text.
       DELIM;

Hexadecimal Integer
-------------------

Hexadecimal integers are integers with an hexadecimal representation. Their value is the same, yet their are written in a different way than the common decimal. 

Hexadecimal has native support in PHP with the ``0x123`` format. There is also support for hexadecimal characters, inside double-quote strings, with the ``\xhh`` syntax.

There are functions to convert from and to hexadecimal format : hexdec(), dechex() and base_convert(), from ten to sixteen.

PHP also has special syntax for binary and octal numbers. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
       $twenty    = 0x14;
       $twentyToo = 20;

.. _hexagonal:
.. _hexagonal-architecture:

Hexagonal Architecture
----------------------

Hexagonal architecture, also known as Ports and Adapters architecture or the Onion architecture, is a software architectural pattern that promotes the separation of concerns and emphasizes modularity and flexibility. It was introduced by Alistair Cockburn in 2005 as a way to address the challenges of building maintainable and testable software systems.

In hexagonal architecture, the core principle is the isolation of the application's business logic from external dependencies such as databases, frameworks, user interfaces, and external services. The architecture consists of three main components:

    Core/Application Layer: This layer represents the business logic or the application's core functionality. It encapsulates the use cases and domain models that define the behavior of the system. The core does not depend on any specific technologies or external systems.

    Ports and Adapters: This layer acts as a boundary between the application and its external dependencies. It consists of two types of components:
    
    Ports: These are interfaces or contracts that define the interaction between the core/application layer and the external systems. They provide a way for the core to communicate its needs and receive data or trigger actions.
    
    Adapters: These are the implementations of the ports, connecting the core with the external systems. Adapters translate the core's requests into a format that external systems can understand and vice versa. They handle the technical details of communication, such as data persistence, network protocols, or user interface rendering.

    External Systems: This layer includes databases, frameworks, user interfaces, messaging systems, or any other external dependencies. The core does not have direct knowledge of these systems. Instead, it communicates through the defined ports and relies on the adapters to interact with them.

The hexagonal architecture promotes loose coupling, which makes the system more maintainable, testable, and adaptable to changes. It allows for easier swapping of external dependencies or modifying user interfaces without affecting the core business logic. The separation of concerns and clear boundaries between layers also make the system easier to understand and reason about.

HG is another name for Mercurial, which is a distributed version control system (DVCS) similar to Git. Mercurial is designed to help developers manage and track changes to source code and other files, just like Subversion and Git. It is often used for collaborative software development and version control of various types of digital assets.

`Documentation <https://www.mercurial-scm.org/>`__

.. _html-entities:

HTML Entities
-------------

HTML entities are a way to write special characters. For example, the superior and inferior characters have a special meaning in HTML. To be able to display them correctly, it is recommended to use the following writing : ``&gt;``  and ``&lt;``.

This protection is extended to many characters. They have a numerical entity, such as ``&38;`` and a literal entity, such as ``&amp;``, for the ampersand. 

Such entities are typical of HTML. They are different in different languages. 

PHP uses htmlentities() and html_entities_decode() to convert those characters from and to their entities.

HTML entities are useful in the HTML code, but they are confusing in a text file, which has no special entity.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // echo &amp;
   echo htmlentities("&");
   
   ?>


`Documentation <https://www.freeformatter.com/html-entities.html>`__

Related : :ref:`Entities <entity>`

.. _html-entity:

HTML entity
-----------

HTML entities are special character sequences, that represents a single character. Such representation is not needed for simple characters, such as the Latin alphabet. On the other hand, they are needed for unusual characters, in particular when the encoding cannot be guaranteed to support it. 

They are also needed to display characters, which have a special meaning, such as double quote `"`, or the greater `>` and lesser signs `<`. 

HTML entities makes the source code longer, and harder to read. 

HTML entities may have a letter representation, while they always have a numeric representation. For example, the ampersand may be written `\&amp;` and `\&#38;`.

PHP has functions to decode (turn HTML entities into characters) and encode (turn characters into HTML entities) : htmlentities() and htmlentities_decode(), htmlspecialchars() and htmlspecialchars_decode(). The get_html_translation_table() provides the full list of supported entities. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   echo htmlentities('&'); // &amp;
   
   print htmlentities_decode('&lt;A&gt;'); // <A>

.. _http-code:

HTTP Code
---------

HTTP status codes are three-digit numeric codes that are returned by web servers to indicate the outcome of a client's request to a server. These codes are a part of the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) standard and provide information about the status of the request and the server's response. HTTP status codes are grouped into different ranges, each with a specific meaning.

Here are some of the most common HTTP status codes and their general meanings:

1xx (Informational):

    100 Continue: The server has received the request headers and the client should proceed to send the request body.
    101 Switching Protocols: The server is switching protocols according to the client's request.
    102 Processing: The server has received the request and is processing it, but no response is available yet.
    103 Early Hints: This status code is used to return some response headers before final HTTP message.

2xx (Successful):

    200 OK: The request was successful, and the server has returned the requested resource.
    201 Created: The request was successful, and a new resource was created as a result.
    202 Accepted: The request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed. 
    202 Non-Authoritative Information: The server is a transforming proxy (e.g. a Web accelerator) that received a 200 OK from its origin, but is returning a modified version of the origin's response. 
    204 No Content: The server has successfully processed the request, but there is no content to send in the response.

3xx (Redirection):

    301 Moved Permanently: The requested resource has been permanently moved to a new location.
    302 Found: The requested resource has been temporarily moved to a different location.
    303 See Other: The requested resource has been temporarily moved to a different location.
    304 Not Modified: The client's cached version of the resource is still valid; no content is returned.

4xx (Client Error):

    400 Bad Request: The request from the client was malformed or invalid.
    401 Unauthorized: Authentication is required, and the client needs to provide valid credentials.
    402 Payement Required: Reserved for future use. 
    403 Forbidden: The client does not have permission to access the requested resource.
    404 Not Found: The requested resource was not found on the server.
    405 Method Not Allowed: A request method is not supported for the requested resource.

5xx (Server Error):

    500 Internal Server Error: The server encountered an error while processing the request.
    501 Not Implemented: The server either does not recognize the request method, or it lacks the ability to fulfil the request.
    502 Bad Gateway: The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, received an invalid response from an upstream server.
    503 Service Unavailable: The server is currently unable to handle the request due to temporary overloading or maintenance of the server.
    504 Gateway Timeout: The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, did not receive a timely response from an upstream server.
    505 HTTP Version Not Supported: The server does not support the HTTP version used in the request.

HTTP headers are extra information, exchanged between the server and the client, to configure further the network transaction. 

They are separated from the content, which usually represents the HTML page, or the binary  code of the image, archive. 

HTTP headers have a name, and a value. They are made of ASCII text, and separated by a colon `:`

HTTP headers are the same with HTTPS.

In PHP, they are handled by the functions prefixed by ``header_`` : headers_sent(), headers_list(), header(), header_remove(), header_register_callback().

Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
-----------------------------------

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol is an application layer protocol in the Internet protocol. 

It is also a wrapper for network communication in PHP, allowing it to be used directly with functions such as file_get_contents().

HTTP is related to HTTPS, the secure version of HTTP.

.. _iconv:

Iconv
-----

``iconv`` is a PHP extension that stands for "Internationalized CONVersion". It provides functionality to convert strings between different character encodings, making it useful for dealing with multilingual and internationalized applications.

The ``iconv`` extension allows you to convert strings from one character encoding to another, and it also supports transliteration and character set detection. This is particularly important when dealing with data that may come from different sources with various character encodings.

``iconv`` is both a PHP function, a PHP extension and an independant library for character encoding conversion. 

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
     echo 'TRANSLIT : ', iconv("UTF-8", "ISO-8859-1//TRANSLIT", $text), PHP_EOL;
     // TRANSLIT : This is the Euro symbol 'EUR'.
   ?>

.. _identical:

Identical operator
------------------

Identical is the state of two variables, which contains the same data, with the same type. It is the same as equality, without the type-juggling.

Identical operators are `===`, `!==`. The match() command also uses identical comparisons.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   var_dump(0 == "0000"); // true
   var_dump(0 === "0");   // false
   var_dump(0 === 0);     // true

Related : :ref:`Comparison <comparison-operator>`

.. _if-then:

If Then Else
------------

A if-then-else command branches the execution based on an condition. When the condition is true, the first branch, called ``then`` is executed. When the condition is false, the second branch, called ``else``, is executed. 

If-then structures may be chained with the `elseif` keyword. The else branch is then a new if-then structure, with a second condition. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $number = rand(0, 10);
   
   if ($number % 2 === 0) {
   	print "$number is even\n";
   } else {
   	print "$number is odd\n";

.. _iffectation:

Iffectation
-----------

An iffection is both an assignation and a condition at the same time. 

Assignation is a condition is debated. It makes the code less readable, as the assignation is hidden in the if condition.

It also saves some extra lines of code, when the condition applies to something that will immediately be used. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   if ($x = foo()) { }
   
   // same, without the iffectation
   $x = foo();
   if ($x) { }
   
   
   ?>


.. _imagickexception:

ImagickException
----------------

The ImagickException exception is thrown when an error happens while processing an Imagick operation.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   try {
       $imagick->gammaImage($correction, \Imagick::CHANNEL_ALL);
   } catch (\ImagickException $e) {

.. _immutable:

Immutable
---------

An immutable object is an object that can't be changed. It may be created, read and cloned. On the other hand, a mutable object may change when one of its method is called, even if this is not visible from the outside.

Immutable objects are thread-safe. 

Immutable objects often return a clone version of themself after a modification. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
   
   class x {
   	private $x = 0;
   	
   	function inc() : self {
   		$return = clone $this;
   		$return->x +=1;
   		
   		return $return;
   	}
   }
   
   $a = new x();
   $b = $a->inc();
   
   // $a and $b are two distinct objects

.. _implements:

implements
----------

Implements is a keyword, dedicated to classes. It specify which interfaces a class implements.

Implemented interfaces may be tested with types, instanceof, and is_a().

The list of implemented interfaces is accessible with the class_implements() function.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   interface i {
       function fooi() ;
   }
   
   // empty interface 
   interface j { }
   
   class x implements i, j {

Inclusion
---------

Inclusion is the process to read an external file, and evaluate with the current application for execution. It may define new structures, and execute code. 

Inclusion relies on four language structures : include, require, include_once, require_once. 

Inclusion is often hidden in autoload() functions : the code is included class per class, upon request. 



.. code-block:: php
   
    vars.php
   <?php
   
   $color = 'green';
   $fruit = 'apple';
   
   ?>

`Documentation <https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.include.php>`__

.. _inclusion:

Inclusions
----------

Inclusion is the operation to add PHP code stored in an external file, into another PHP code. 

Inclusions rely on four native functions: ``include``, ``require``, ``include_once``, ``require_once``. 

Inclusions have application with templates, configurations, caches, function libraries. 

Inclusions have been superseeded by autoload in recent PHP versions. Autoload relies on inclusion, though.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   echo "A $color $fruit"; // A
   
   include 'vars.php';

.. _incoming-data:

Incoming Data
-------------

Incoming data are data submitted to PHP by the user. They may come in different way : GET, POST, cookies or files; and, by extension, $_REQUEST. 

Incoming data should always be checked before usage. Their value may have been modified by the author of the source, and carry some malicious payload.

The encoding of the incoming data are controled with the `default_charset` directive.

By extension, incoming data may be used to every source of data that is not PHP itself : files, databases, API, etc. Then, they should be treated the same way, with checks on format and value before usage. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
   
   if ($_GET['x'] === '1') {
   	print "You provided a one digit. Thanks!";
   } else {

.. _index:

Index
-----

An index may be several things : 

+ An identifier in an array
+ A optimized datastructure for a SQL database



Related : :ref:`MVC <mvc>`, :ref:`Index for arrays <index-array>`, :ref:`Index for SQL <index-sql>`

.. _index-array:

Index for arrays
----------------

A index is the identifier of an specific element in an array. They may automatically generated, by simply omitting them at creation time. 

PHP index may be integers or strings only. Other data types generate an error or a type conversion. For example, floats are turned into integer. integer-shaped strings will also be turned into integer.

PHP index start at 0. They may be automatically assigned by appending a new value with the `[]` operator : then, they use the greatest available index + 1.


.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
       $array = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
       
       echo $array[0];
   ?>

Related : :ref:`Array <array>`

.. _index-sql:

Index for SQL
-------------

In SQL, an index is a database object that improves the performance of data retrieval operations on database tables. It is a data structure that provides a quick lookup mechanism for finding specific data within a table.

An index is created on one or more columns of a table and contains a sorted copy of the data in those columns, along with a pointer to the original data. This allows the database engine to locate and retrieve the required data more efficiently, reducing the need for scanning the entire table.

Indexes provide the following benefits:

    Improved query performance: By creating an index on frequently queried columns, the database engine can quickly locate the relevant data, resulting in faster query execution times.

    Efficient data retrieval: Indexes allow the database to perform index-based seeks or scans instead of full table scans, which can significantly reduce the amount of disk I/O and improve overall system performance.

    Sorting and ordering: Indexes can be used to sort the data in a specific order, which is helpful when retrieving data in a specific sequence, such as ascending or descending order.

    Constraint enforcement: Indexes can be used to enforce unique constraints and primary key constraints on a table, ensuring data integrity and preventing duplicate or NULL values.

However, indexes also have some considerations:

    Overhead: Indexes consume disk space and require additional processing time for index maintenance during data modifications (inserts, updates, and deletes). So, creating too many indexes or indexes on frequently updated columns can impact performance.

    Maintenance: Indexes need to be maintained as the underlying data changes. This includes updating the index when data is inserted, modified, or deleted, which can impact overall system performance.

    Choosing the right columns: It's important to carefully choose the columns to index based on the specific queries and usage patterns of the database. Indexing every column is not always necessary or beneficial.

.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
       $array = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
       
       echo $array[0];
   ?>

.. _inequality:

Inequality
----------

Inequalities are the mathematical comparison of values, with the `>`,  `>=`,  `<` and `=<` operators. 

Unlike the equality operators, they do not have a strict version, which takes into account the type of the values. Hence, the compared values are always adapted to each other's type.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // displays false
   var_dump("3" > 3);
   
   // displays true

Injection is the usage of a resource (data, object, services...) that is provided to the method, by the caller.

There are good injections, as the dependency injection.

There are bad injections : all the security ones. SQL injection, PHP code injection, CSV injection, XML injection, etc. Those attempt to change reroute the execution of the method to gain access to unprotected resources.

--------

An instance is an object with a class. The class provides the definitions of the behavior of that object, while the object holds the specific data. 

The creation of an instance, called instantiation, is done with the `new` keyword. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class x {
   	private int $property;

`instanceof` is used to determine whether a PHP variable is an instantiated object of a certain class. It is related to the function is_a().

`instanceof` has a higher precedence than `!` operator, so it is applied before the latter.  In case of confusion, use parenthesis.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   if ($user instanceof Administrator) {
       $user->admin();
   }
   
   // If The user is not of class User...

Insteadof
---------

The insteadof operator is used in the context of trait composition and resolving conflicts between methods or properties of multiple traits that are being used in a class.

When a class uses multiple traits that have methods or properties with the same name, naming conflicts can arise. The insteadof operator helps to resolve these conflicts by specifying which trait's implementation should be used in the class.

   <?php
   
   // Example from the PHP documentation
   trait A {
       public function smallTalk() {

Internationalization
--------------------

Internationalization is the process to make the human interface of a program in a local language. 

PHP includes some internationalization capabilities, via the locale, for dates or money format, or with the ext/intl extension. 

Most of the interface translations for application is done with specific components, such as `Symfony/translation`. Translation of interface messages is part of this concept.

Internationalization is also called `i18n`, aka i, 18 letters and n. This is shorter to write. This word may be written with a z or an s, depending on the flavor of English being used.

Interpolation is the PHP feature that automatically replaces variables and public properties by their value in double-quoted strings and Heredoc syntax.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   $string = "world";
   echo "Hello $string"; 
   // displays Hello world
   
   ?>

.. _intersection-type:

Intersection Type
-----------------

Intersection types, also called intersectional types, is a specification syntax where several types act together as a single typehint. The individual types are separated with the & operator. 

The value typed with an intersection type must satisfy all the types at the same time. 

Intersection types don't work with scalar values, which are excluding one another. It works with polymorphism, where one object may be of several types at the same time, when implementing interfaces. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class x {
   	// Property is of type A, B and C at the same time. 
   	// Two of them have to be interfaces.
       private A & B & C $property;
   }
   
   ?>

.. _invalidargumentexception:

InvalidArgumentException
------------------------

Exception thrown if an argument is not of the expected type. It is a LogicException, and it may be thrown when using SPL classes.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   function foo(string $a) {}
   
   // OK
   foo("abc");

.. _isset:

Isset
-----

isset() is a function that determines if a variable is declared and is different than null.

Isset() is also related to the magic method __isset(), which is used to determine if a property in an object exists or not. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $var = 'something';
   
   if (isset($var)) {
       echo 'The variable $var contains '.$var;

.. _jobqueue:

Jobqueue
--------

A job queue is a concept that refers to a system or data structure used to manage and schedule the execution of various tasks or jobs in a sequential or parallel manner. 

Job queues are commonly used in scenarios where there is a need to process multiple tasks asynchronously, ensuring that tasks are executed efficiently and in an organized manner.

A job queue may organize the tasks in different way : by priority, by type, by sequence, by estimated load, by available worker, etc. 


`Documentation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_queue>`__

.. _json:

JSON
----

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   $array = array('a' => 1, 'b' => "c", 'c' => [3, 4], 'd' => new stdclass());
   
   echo json_encode($arr);
   // displays {"a":1,"b":"c","c":[3,4],"d":{}}

.. _jit:

Just In Time
------------

Just-In-Time compilation is a technique used in computer science and programming languages to improve the runtime performance of code execution.

In traditional interpretation of programming languages like PHP, code is executed line by line by an interpreter. This can lead to some performance bottlenecks, especially for code that is executed frequently or for applications that require high throughput.

With Just-In-Time compilation, the code is not interpreted line by line. Instead, it's analyzed and compiled into machine code just before it's executed. This compiled code is then stored in memory and can be executed much more efficiently than interpreted code. This approach can significantly improve the performance of a programming language.

.. _key-value-store:

Key-value stores
----------------

A key value store is a server which stores data like a hash. The server stores values as a collection, and each object is identified with a unique key. 

Classic key-value stores include memcache, redis, tokyo-tyrant.

.. _keyword:

Keyword
-------

PHP has a list of keywords, which are also called reserved words. Those are names used with some functions or operators. 

Keywords are not allowed in function, constant, class, interface, enum and trait names. They are allowed in method, properties, variables and class cosntant names.

While legit, it is usually recommended to avoid using PHP keywords as identifiers, so as to prevent confusion. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class myNamespace {
   	function array() {
   		return array();
   	}
   }
   
   print_r((new myNamespace)->array());
   
   ?>


.. _language-construct:

Language construct
------------------

PHP has 'language construct', which are special keywords, with an attached feature. 

Language constructs are : echo, require, require_once, include, include_once, return, die, exit, unset, isset, print, empty.

Language constructs usually do not require parenthesis, and they are mostly known for that. The parenthesis is not necessary, but possible. It makes the language construct look like a function call. 

Also, language construct do not behave like a function, so they can't be used by their name, as a callback. 

There have some special behavior : echo accepts an arbitrary number of argument, while print only accepts one. die and exit work without arguments, but, in the event that an argument is provided, it must be enclosed in parenthesis.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   echo 'a', 'b', 'c';
   
   die;
   
   ?>

.. _late-static-binding:
.. _late-binding:

Late Static Binding
-------------------

PHP implements a feature called late static bindings which can be used to reference the called class in a context of static inheritance.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   class A {
       public static function who() {
           echo __CLASS__;
       }
       public static function test() {
           static::who(); // Here comes Late Static Bindings
       }
   }
   
   class B extends A {

.. _lazy-loading:

Lazy Loading
------------

Lazy loading is a programming technic that postpone the actual loading of a resource to the moment it is actually used. 

This prevents the application from loading resources that may not be used later : it improves efficiency. 

Lazy loading happens with data and source code. Some entities may be loaded only when they are actually needed, to avoid loading too much data from the repositories, while they are not used. 

PHP also uses lazy loading: some structures are checked at linting time, when they are available. Otherwise, their validation is defered to execution. For example, method signature compatibility with parents, or class constant values. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
   
   class File {
   	private $path;
   	private $content = null;
   
   	function __construct($path) {
   		$this->path = $path;
   	}
   
   	function get() {
   		if ($this->content === null) {
   			$this->content = file_get_contents($path);
   		}
   		
   		return $this->content;
   	}
   }
   
   $file = new File($path);
   // some more code
   echo $file->getContent();
   
   class ErroneousConstant {
   	const VALID = 1;
   	// invalid value for the INVALID constant
   	const INVALID = [] + 1;
   }
   
   // displays 1
   echo ErroneousConstant::VALID;
   // This produces a Fatal error, even though it could be detected before. 
   echo ErroneousConstant::INVALID;

.. _lengthexception:

LengthException
---------------

The LengthException exception is thrown if a length is invalid.

LengthException are defined by the SPL extension. It is not natively used. 

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   function foo(string $s) {
       if (empty($s)) {
          throw new \UnexpectedValueException('Foo() expects a non-empty string');

.. _letter-logical:

Letter Logical Bug
------------------

PHP offers two sets of operators for logical operations : the letter operators (and, or, xor) and the symbol operators (&&, ||, no xor in symbol).

While they do the same, those operators have a difference : they do not share the same precedence. In particular, && has higher priority than = while = has higher priority than and. This leads to a difference in execution.

When combining ``=`` and ``&&``, the logical operation happens before the assignation. While combining ``=`` and ``and`` actually ignore the logical operation.

The same problem affect yield, yield from, print, all assignations, including the short assignations, the ternary operator and the null-coalesce. 

It is recommended to always use the symbol logical operators, which is closer to human expectations. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $a = 1 && 3;
   
   $b = 1 and 3;
   // equivalent to 
   ($b = 1) and 3;

.. _linting:
.. _lint:

Linting
-------

Linting is the process to turn the Text file that holds the source code, into tokens. During this first phase, PHP applies some checks, and report anything that makes no sense.

After linting, the code is processed further before reaching the status of opcode, where it can be executed. 

Linting is an option of the PHP CLI : `-l`. 

Linting is sometimes mistaken with 'compiling' : linting is a part of a compilation. Since, it is the only step available in PHP between the code and the execution (with eval() or the PHP CLI), linting is often considered as compiling. 



.. _lsp:
.. _liskov:

Liskov Substitution Principle

.. _list:

List
----

List() acts as the contrary to array() : it will break an array into individual elements, and assign them to the arguments of the list. 

List() also has a short array version, which is `[ ]` the square brackets. Those square brackets are only appearing on the left side of an assignation. 

list() may omit extracted values by skipping their value, and leaving seemingly empty arguments. List() also supports double-arrow notation, where the key is provided. 

list() may be nested. It may also be used with foreach() structures.

list() looks like a function, though it is the only one to appears on the left part of an assignation, and is actually a language-construct.

A list is also the name given to arrays where the index are the automatic ones. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   list($a, $b, $c) = [1,2,3];
   
   [$a, , [$c]] = [1,2,[3],4];
   
   [2 => $c, 0 => $a] = [1,2,3,4];
   
   $rows = [[1,2], [3, 4]];
   foreach($rows as [$a, $b]) {
       print "$a + $b\n";
   }
   
   // Only values are important here
   $list = range(10, 12);

Logical operators
-----------------

Logical operators applies four logical functions to booleans. 

+ ``and`` and ``&&``
+ ``or`` and ``||``
+ ``xor`` (no symbolic version for ``xor``)
+ ``!``  (no letter version for ``not``)

The logical operators are either symbolic or letter. Be aware that the symbolic operators have a higher precedence than the letter one, in particular vis-à-vis comparisons.

The logical operators work on various types, and output booleans. They are different from the bitwise operators, which work on the value as a bit level, not as a whole.

.. _loop:

Loops
-----

A loop is a control structure that allows you to execute a block of code repeatedly based on a specified condition. Loops are essential for automating repetitive tasks and processing arrays or collections of data. PHP provides several types of loops, including: for, while, do...while and foreach.

The most popular loop is foreach().

Loops may hide in certain functions : for example, array_map() and array_walk() apply a method to every element in an array. 

Generators are closely related to the foreach() loop. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   foreach([11,12,13] as $id => $value) {
       print "$id => $value\n";
   }
   
   for ($i = 1; $i <= 10; $i++) {
       echo $i;
   }
   
   $i = 10;
   while ($i <= 10) {
       echo $i++;  
   }

.. _magic:

Magic
-----

Magic is mostly used in the sentence : 'There is too much magic in this code'. It usually refers to convention which triggers certain behavior, which is not explicit in the code, but rather documented and learnt.

.. _magic-constant:

Magic Constants
---------------

Constants which hold information about the current location of the code.

Those constants are magic, because they have a constant syntax, yet their value may change, even during the execution of the code. 

+ __LINE__	The current line number of the file.
+ __FILE__	The full path and filename of the file with symlinks resolved. If used inside an include, the name of the included file is returned.
+ __DIR__	The directory of the file. If used inside an include, the directory of the included file is returned. This is equivalent to dirname(__FILE__). This directory name does not have a trailing slash unless it is the root directory.
+ __FUNCTION__	The function name, or {closure} for anonymous functions.
+ __CLASS__	The class name. The class name includes the namespace it was declared in (e.g. Foo\Bar). When used in a trait method, __CLASS__ is the name of the class the trait is used in.
+ __TRAIT__	The trait name. The trait name includes the namespace it was declared in (e.g. Foo\Bar).
+ __METHOD__	The class method name.
+ __NAMESPACE__ The name of the current namespace.

Those constants are case insensitive. All those syntax will work : `__METHOD__`, `__method__`, `__meTHod__`.

.. _magic hash:

Magic Hash
----------

A magic hash is a hash string which is mistakenly compared to another hash. 

In the example below, the same MD5 hash is taken for two distinct strings, which ends up being identical, per `==`. 

In reality, the two hashes are different strings : `0e462097431906509019562988736854` and `0e830400451993494058024219903391` respectively. When they are compared, as strings, PHP identifies the initial 0 of the strings, and assume the comparison should be an integer comparison.

Each string is turned into a int, which are 0 in both cases. Hence, the comparison succeeds, yet it wrong.

The protection against magic hashes is to use the identity operator `===`, rather than the equality. It makes a type comparison and do not apply type juggling, which leads to the two hashs above different. 

This example is applicable with any hash algorithm which produces a string that starts with 0. Check the magic hash repository for examples with SHA256, HAVAL, PHOTON, RIPEMD or SPONGENT.

There are PHP functions and operators that perform safe comparisons ,such as `===`, `!==` and hash_equals().



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   var_dump(md5('240610708') == md5('QNKCDZO'));
   
   //md5('240610708')
   //0e462097431906509019562988736854
   //md5('QNKCDZO')
   //0e830400451993494058024219903391

.. _magic-method:

Magic Methods
-------------

Special methods, which provide extended support for PHP features.

The magic methods are  : __call(), __callStatic(), __get(), __set(), __isset(), __unset(), __sleep(), __wakeup(), __toString(), __invoke(), __set_state(), __clone() and __debugInfo().

The constructor and destructors are not considered as magic methods, even though they are reserved. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class x {
       //
       function __get($name) {
           return $this->$name;

.. _magic-number:

Magic Numbers
-------------

A magic number is a number that appears in the code, and has no obvious signification. 

It is recommended to make the meaning of that number obvious. This is achieved by using constants, class or global, where the name of the constant improves readability.

Magic numbers also applies to other literal values, such as string, float, arrays. Though, they are more difficult to sort out of the code.

Magic numbers are difficult to categorize, when they are very common across different fields. For example, 0, 1, 2, 10 are very common for different tasks, and may need several disambiguations.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   foreach($array as $id => $values) {
   	// Only displaying 10 values, but couldn't that limit be parametered?
   	if ($id > 10) {
   		break;
   	}
   	
   	print $values.PHP_EOL;
   }
   
   ?>

.. _magic-property:

Magic Property
--------------

Special properties, which are not declared, but dynamically handled by the magic methods. They do not have specific declaration. 

The magic methods to handle magic properties are :  __get(), __set(), __isset() and __unset().

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class x {
       //
       function __get($name) {
           return 'World!';

.. _map:

Map
---

A map refers to an abstract data type (ADT) that stores key-value pairs, where each key is unique within the map. In PHP, this feature is supported by array. 

PHP's array syntax supports a feature to assign the index an arbitrary key. A map allows efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion of values based on their associated keys. The key-value pairs are typically unordered, meaning that the order of insertion may not be preserved when iterating over the map's elements.

Maps are also called associative array, dictionary, or hashes.

Maps are useful to associate a value with a specific key and perform operations like searching for a value by its key or updating the value associated with a key. They provide a convenient way to store and retrieve data based on some unique identifier.



.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
   
   // explicit keys : this is a map
   $array = array('a' => 0, 2 => 1, '123' => 2);
   
   
   // keys are assigned automatically
   $array = array(0, 1, 2);
   
   ?>

.. _match:

Match
-----

The ``match`` expression is the remote cousin of the ``switch``. It takes a value, branch among a list of cases, or fallback to a default one, and returns a unique value. 

``match`` use a strict comparison for the comparison. ``match`` raise an error if no case match, unless the ``default`` case is provided. 

``match`` is an expression, to be used in an assignement, while ``switch`` is a command, and must be used alone. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $return_value = match ($food) {
       'apple' => 'This food is an apple',
       'bar'   => 'This food is a bar',
       'cake'  => 'This food is a cake',
       default => 'This is not food'
   };

.. _max_execution_time:

max_execution_time
------------------

The ``max_execution_time`` directive sets the maximum amount of time that PHP will work on an application. 

The default value is 30 seconds. It may be lowered down to 1 second, or set to infinity with -1.

``max_execution_time`` may be changed from the code with set_time_limit(). This function may also be disabled, and not available.

It is recommended to set this value as low as possible, and optimize the code to run below that limit.

.. _md5:

MD5
---

MD5 is a hash function, that produce a 128-bit footprint for a value. 

MD5 was used a lot for secure hashing and control. Nowadays, it may be useful for hashing and comparing data, though it is not considered secure. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   //Generate a MD5 hash with the history md5() native function
   echo hash('md5', 'Le rapide goupil brun sauta par dessus le chien paresseux.');
   
   //Generate a MD5 hash with the history md5() native function

.. _memoization:

Memoization
-----------

Memoization is an optimisation technique to speed up a function by avoiding re-processing previously calculated results. 

Usually, memoization trades processing time with memory. The best suited situation are when the load takes some time to process, and the result is a small amount of memory, such as a count. 

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   function docs($file) {
       // local cache 
       static $cache = [];
       
       // If it was already cached, use it. 
       // Docs are supported to be constant during the execution
       if (isset($cache[$file])) {
           return $cache[$file];
       }
       
       $cache[$file] = file_get_contents($file) ?? '';

.. _message-queue:

Message Queue
-------------

A message queue server is a middleware component or service that facilitates communication between different software components or systems by enabling asynchronous message passing. It provides a mechanism for sending, storing, and receiving messages between different parts of an application or between separate applications, often across distributed or networked environments.

Message queues are commonly used in scenarios where components need to communicate and exchange data without requiring immediate responses or direct interaction. This decoupling of components through asynchronous communication offers several advantages, including improved scalability, fault tolerance, and responsiveness.

.. _method:

Method
------

Methods are function dedicated to a class. They are defined inside the body of a class, and may only be access in relation to that class : via an object, the class name or another method. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class x {
       public function foo() {
           echo "I am foo!\n";
       }
   }
   
   $x = new Y();
   $y->foo(); // calling the foo method, defined in x,

.. _micro-optimisation:

Micro-optimisation
------------------

A micro-optimisation is a piece of code that performs better than another, yet brings only a small gain of speed.

Micro-optimisation should be done only for highly constraints systems, or application that deliver a high number of hits in short times : usually, it takes one to ten millions usage for the gain to be visible. 

Yet, micro-optimisations may be valuable on the long run, or as a good practice. 

It is often a pointless to discuss the micro-optimisation. It is a do or don't, and should raise a consensus, or left alone.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // this is faster than calling 3 times echo
   echo 1, 2, 3;
   
   // This is slower, yet it doesn't speed up the process a lot
   echo 1;
   echo 2;
   echo 3;

.. _migration:

Migration
---------

Migration is the incremental upgrade of a piece of code. 

It is often used for databases, for example, with Laravel database migrations; for components and frameworks : for example, CakePHP migration.

Usually, migration requires some action from the user, although a migration script may be provided.

Migration may also be called upgrades.

.. _mixed:

Mixed
-----

A special type that represents any available type. It is equivalent to not explicitly setting the type, though it is now explicitly done. 

A ``mixed`` type may be also represented by a union of all possible types. 

``mixed`` is useful when literally any type should be supported, such as with a cache system. Yet, it is usually recommended to consider reducing the number of possible types by using a common interface or a union type. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   function cache(string $name, mixed $value) : bool {
   	static $cache = [];
   	
   	$cache[$name] = $value;

.. _mock:

Mock
----

A mock replaces a code dependency with an object, to make testing easier. Mocks are used when the dependency is difficult to set in a reproducible state : for example, in a rare state, or after a long set up.

Mocks turns the dependency into another piece of code, with total control over its behavior. 

On the other hand, mocks have to be coded to replace the dependency, and emulates its behavior as closely as possible : any change to the dependency behavior has to be back-ported. 

Mock objects are also called ``test double``.

Multidimensional Array
----------------------

An array inside an array is called a multidimensional array. Dimensions may be created as many as necessary, by using the square brackets.

PHP creates the arrays on the fly. When the intermediate array are undefined, PHP will add them in the structure.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $a = array(1 => array('a' => 1));
   
   $a[1]["b"]['c'] = 3;

.. _mutation-test:

Mutation Testing
----------------

Mutation testing is a way to enhance the quality of tests by checking how they react to a small perturbation of the code source.

After writing a suite of tests and having it pass, mutation testing adds a modification to the code : for example, replacing a `+` by a `-`. Then, it runs the test suite again, and the expectation is that one test (at least) should spot the error. That way, the code is well bordered by the tests. 

When the suite is still green after mutating the code, this means that the test suite is not sufficient to spot it. The code is now a mutant, and the test suite should be updated.

`Infection` is a PHP mutation Testing framework.

.. _mysqli_sql_exception:

mysqli_sql_exception
--------------------

mysqli_sql_exception is thrown when a mysqli related error is found. 

When an error occurs during a database operation using the MySQLi extension, such as a failed database connection or a syntax error in a query, a mysqli_sql_exception exception can be thrown.

Methods like ``commit``, ``query``, ``prepare``, ``execute_query``, ``rollback``, ``real_query``, ``real_connect``, ``__construct``,  ``reap_async_query`` all throw exceptions when the strict mode is activated.

.. _n-query:

N+1 Query Problem
-----------------

The "N+1 query problem" is a term used in the context of database queries, often in the context of Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) systems. This issue arises when a program queries a database for a set of entities (usually rows from a table) and then, for each of those entities, issues an additional query to retrieve related data. This leads to a large number of individual queries being executed, which can result in poor performance and increased database load.

Here's a breakdown of the issue:

+ Initial Query (N queries): The program retrieves a set of main entities, let's say a list of users. This query retrieves 'N' records.

+ Subsequent Queries (+1 queries): For each of the 'N' users, the program issues a separate query to fetch additional related data, such as user roles, posts, comments, etc. This results in an additional 'N' queries.

As a result, you end up with a total of 'N+1' queries, hence the term "N+1 query problem". This approach can cause significant performance issues, as executing many individual queries can be slower than fetching the required data in a more optimized way.

.. _named-constructor:

Named Constructors
------------------

Named constructor is a class organisation, where several static factories are created to instantiate the object, based on arguments. They usually prepare the argument, to call the constructor the right way. 

That approaches makes the construction of the object simpler, and reduces the number of conditionals. 

As Matthias Verraes puts it : 'Don't limit yourself by PHP's single constructor. Use static factory methods.'.

.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
   
   // parse a single string
   $user = Person::createFromTitle('Mr John Smith');
   
   $user = Person::createFromNames('John', 'Smith');
   
   class Person {
   	// constructor is private, $parameters are not documented
   	private function __construct( ) {}
   	
   	static public function createFromNames(string $firstName, string $lastName) : self {
   		// assign the argument to the right parameter of the constructor
   	}
   
   	static public function createFromTitle(string $fullName) : self {
   		// parse the string, and calls the constructor
   	}

.. _named-parameter:

Named Parameters
----------------

Named parameters, also known as named arguments allow to pass arguments to a function or method by specifying the parameter name along with the corresponding value, rather than relying on the order of the parameters.

In traditional positional parameter passing, the values are provided to a function in the order in which the parameters are defined. However, with named parameters, the parameter to which a value is passed, is explicitly stated.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   function foo($a, $b) {
       return $a - $b;
   }
   
   echo foo(2, 3);  // return -1
   echo foo(3, 2);  // return 1
   
   echo foo(a: 2, b: 3);  // return -1
   echo foo(b: 2, a: 3);  // return 1

.. _namespace-alias:

Namespace Alias
---------------

PHP can alias, or import, constants, functions, classes, interfaces, traits, enumerations and namespaces. 

This makes the code shorter, as the imported structure can be called with its alias name, instead of the fully qualified name. 

Aliasing solves naming conflicts, by giving another local name to any structure. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   namespace a {
       class x {

.. _naming:

Naming
------

`naming` refers to the process of choosing appropriate names for variables, functions, classes, constants, traits, interfaces, enum, methods, parameters and  any other programming elements. 

Good naming practices are essential for writing readable, maintainable, and understandable code. Clear and meaningful names make it easier for developers (including yourself) to understand the purpose and functionality of different parts of the codebase.

Native
------

A feature is called 'native' or 'built-in' when it is part of the standard installation of PHP. For example, `.` (dot operator) or the `stdClass` class are native to PHP.

On the other hand, a feature is custom : that is, when defined by the developer or a PHP extension. 

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // This is a native function
   $s = strtolower($s);

Nesting
-------

Nesting refers to the practice of placing code block or construct inside another. 

This is commonly used with loops, conditional statements, functions, classes, arrays, generators, attributes, ternaries, try-catch, etc. 

Nesting creates more complex and intricate logic. It usually erodes readability by mixing two contexts in the same code location, or genrating unexpected code.

.. code-block:: php

.. _new:
.. _instantiation:

new
---

new creates a new object from a class. This operation is called the instantiation. 

The class must be available at instantiation call : PHP will search for it in the declared classes, then call the autoloader to find it. In case no class is found, and error is emitted.

The instantiation calls immediately the constructor of the object : it is the method called ``__construct``. 

The constructor defines how many arguments are needed. When no argument is needed, new may also be called without parenthesis.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class x {
       function __construct($a = 1) {}
    }
   
   // instantiation

.. _non-breakable-space:

Non Breakable Spaces
--------------------

Space is one of the base ascii character. They are often used to separate words, and are forbidden from being used in names. 

PHP supports Unicode characters, and some of the characters are called : non breaking spaces. They behave like a space, by displaying a blank area. Yet, they are recognized internally as a non-space, and can be used in a name.

Non-breakable spaces are useful for tests, as they make the testing name more readable. They are also quite rare, and confusing for newcomers.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // This is a space, it won't compile
   const A B = 1;
   
   // This is a non breakabe space, it compile and is not visibly different from the line above
   const A B = 1;

.. _nowdoc:

Nowdocs
-------

Nowdocs is a string syntax, similar to heredoc, and without internal parsing. They are similar to single quoted strings, compared to double quoted ones.

The Nowdocs syntax uses an arbitrary delimiter, which has to be enclosed in single quotes. The same delimiter will mark the end of the string.

Nowdocs are convenient for large amount of text, that has to be hardcoded. Smaller string will be better suited with single-quotes, while even longer text should be stored in an external storage, such as a file.

It is possible to indent the text in a nowdocs string: to avoid this indentation to be passed at execution time, the final delimiter may be indented too. Its indentation will be removed from the parsed text.
 

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $nowdoc = <<<'DELIM'
   This is a long text.
   
   $variable will not be replaced, and the text stays intact.
   
   DELIM;
   
   $nowdoc = <<<'DELIM'
           This still will start at the first word, not at the beginning of the string.
           DELIM;

.. _null:

Null
----

``null`` is a special data type that represents a variable with no value or an undefined value. It is used to indicate the absence of a value. In other words, when a variable is assigned the value null, it means that the variable exists but has no valid data. 

``null`` may be used as a default value for variables, parameter or properties that are expected to hold some value later but don't have a value assigned initially. It was also be used to unset a variable and free up memory, when using the operator ``(unset)``. 

There is also a design pattern called Null Pattern, although its main goal is to remove usage of null and replace it with an actual object. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $a = null;
   
   function foo(?string $s = null) {}
   
   ?>

.. _nullpattern:

Null Pattern
------------

The Null Pattern is a design pattern in software development that addresses the handling of null or undefined values in a more controlled and predictable manner. It is also known as the Null Object Pattern.

In many programming languages, including PHP, ``null`` is often used to indicate the absence of a value or an error condition. However, using ``null`` can lead to unexpected errors or code complexity when developers forget to check for null before using a variable, leading to runtime exceptions or bugs.

The Null Pattern suggests creating a special object to represent the absence of a value instead of using null. This object behaves like a regular object but has default or ``null`` behavior, making it safe to use without explicit null checks.

Key principles of the Null Pattern:

    Null Object: Create a specific class that implements a common interface for the objects in question. This class represents the null state and provides default, empty, or no-op implementations of the interface's methods.

    No Null Checks: Instead of checking for null before using an object, you can safely call methods on the Null Object, knowing that it won't throw exceptions or cause errors. This simplifies the code and avoids conditional logic based on null checks.

    Transparency: Code that interacts with the Null Object should treat it like any other object without needing to handle special cases for null.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   interface Logger {
       public function log($message);
   }
   
   class FileLogger implements Logger {
       public function log($message) {
           // Log the message to a file
       }
   }
   
   class NullLogger implements Logger {

.. _nullsafe-object-operator:

Null Safe Object Operator
-------------------------

The Null Safe Object Operator behaves like the object operator, until the object is null. Then, instead of failing with a fatal error, it returns null.

   <?php
   
   function foo() : ?A {}
   
   class A {
       public $property = 1;
   }

.. _object-injection:

Object Injection
----------------

Object injection happens when a string is deserialized to recreate an object, inside PHP, while the string is controlled by the attacker.

The general synopsis is the following : 
+ PHP serialize an object
+ The serialized string is transmitted to the user, then back to PHP (via cookies, hidden fields, or any storage)
+ PHP deserialize the object

While in the hand of the user, the data was doctored to retain its format validity, but with values that are now controlled by the attacker.

.. _object-invasion:

Object Invasion
---------------

PHP allows objects of one class to access private structures of an object of the same class.

This is useful when cloning or importing objects with __set_state() : within the same class, those methods can create new objects and assign all their properties.

This feature break OOP encapsulation : even when using private visibility, it is possible to access then from outside the object. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
   
   class A {
   	private $p = 0;
   	
   	// accessing a different object

.. _opcode:

Opcode
------

Opcodes (short for "operation codes") refer to low-level instructions that the PHP interpreter uses to execute PHP scripts. When PHP processes a code, it goes through several stages of compilation and interpretation. One of these stages involves translating the human-readable PHP source into a series of opcodes, which are then executed by the PHP engine.

Generaly speaking, coders never come close to opcodes. The only occasion is when configuring the opcode cache: this cache keeps the generated opcodes in memory, and skips the stages of compilation as long as the source is not changed.

.. _operator-precedence:

Operator Precedence
-------------------

The operator precedence dictates in which order the operators in a same sequence are executed. 

For example, in the code `1 + 2 * 3`, the order is the mathematical order : multiplication has precedence over addition. The results is 7, not 9. 

In PHP, operators have different precedence : `.` (dot) has a lower priority than addition `+` and `-`.  

Precedence may lead to unexpected behavior. For example, ``-9 ** 2 == -9``, because ``-`` has lower precedence than ``**``, and PHP doesn't parse negative numbers in one pass. 

Also, `$a = $b & $c;` means that `$a = $b;`, because `=` has a higher priority than `&`.



.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
   
   // 7, not 9
   $a = 1 + 2 * 3;

Operators
---------

An operator is something that takes one or more values (or expressions, in programming jargon) and yields another value (so that the construction itself becomes an expression). 

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // not operator, unary
   $a = !$b;
   
   // plus operator
   $c = $d + 2;
   
   // ternary operator
   $e = $d ? 3 : 2;

.. _optional-parameter:

Optional Parameter
------------------

Optional parameter are parameter fitted with a default value. They may then be skipped when the function is called. 

Optional parameter should be the last parameters : otherwise, PHP will have trouble figuring out which parameter uses which value.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   function foo($a, $b = 2) { }
   
   // $b will be 2, using the default value
   foo(1); 
   
   // $b will be 3
   foo(1, 3); 
   
   ?>

.. _outgoing-data:

Outgoing Data
-------------

Outgoing data are data submitted by PHP to an external user. The default may be the user's browser, and the usual formats may be HTML, or JSON. Yet, there are many other destinations, such as databases, files, API, other process and formats, such as CSV, text, PDF, etc.  

Outgoing data should always be formatted with the target technology. For example, text should use HTML entities for HTML output, or be provided as prepared statement with a database. Each target has its own system of protection.

The encoding of the incoming data are controlled with the `default_charset` directive.



.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
   
   // raw text, for the browser
   echo "Hello world.";

.. _outofrangeexception:

OutOfRangeException
-------------------

OutOfRangeException is a built-in exception class that is used to indicate that an index or value is outside the acceptable range. It is a subclass of the LogicException class.

The OutOfRangeException is typically thrown when accessing an array or collection with an index that is either negative or exceeds the valid range of indices. It can also be thrown when working with iterators or other data structures that have a defined range of valid values. 

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $list = new SplDoublyLinkedList();
   
   try {
       // Adding 5 at index 2, while it should be added a 0 (empty list)
       $list->add(2,5);
   } catch (OutOfRangeException $e) {
       echo "Exception: ".$e->getMessage()."\n";
   }

`Documentation <https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.outofrangeexception.php>`__

.. _overflow:

Overflow
--------

Overflow happens when a value goes beyond a limit : out of its range of existence, the behavior of the value is now unknown.

Overflow happens with integers (limited to PHP_INT_MAX  and PHP_INT_MIN), floats (PHP_FLOAT_MAX and PHP_FLOAT_MIN). 

Other situations, such as accessing an array element or a string character beyond its last element, defaults to returning `null`.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   $a = PHP_INT_MAX;
   $b = (int) ($a +  1);
   
   echo $a.PHP_EOL;

.. _overwrite:
.. _overloading:

Overwrite
---------

Overwriting is the process to replace a method, property or constant that was defined in a parent, by a local definition. This is related to OOP programming and inheritance.

Overwriting is applicable to constants, methods and properties. Methods still should have a compatible signature with their parent's equivalent, while properties and constants may change their (default) value.

Overwriting is prevented by the ``final`` keyword, or the ``private`` visibility.

Overwriting is also called overloading. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class x {
       const Y = 1;
       const Z = 2;
   }
   
   class xx extends x {
       // Z is inherited, and its value is 2    
       // Y used to be 1, it is now 31
       const Y = 31;

Pagination
----------

Pagination is a technique used in web development to break down and display a large set of data or content into smaller, more manageable chunks called pages. This is especially useful when dealing with long lists, tables, or search results, as it enhances user experience and reduces the amount of data loaded at once. Pagination is commonly seen in search engine results, product listings, blog archives, and other scenarios where content needs to be organized across multiple pages.

parent
------

parent is one of the three special keywords that are used to access properties or methods from inside the class definition. It relates to the first parent class, or any or their own parents. In particular, when searching for methods or properties, it may skip the direct parent, and land on one of the parent above.

Parent represents the first parent of the class. 

In a trait, parent represents the host class's parent, not the trait own parent. In fact, the trait has no parent.

.. _parsing:

Parse
-----

To parse, or parsing, refers to the process of analyzing and interpreting the structure of a data to extract meaningful information. 

Parsing is commonly used when working with data formats like XML, JSON, HTML, YAML, or even custom text formats. It involves breaking down a string into its individual components or tokens to understand its underlying structure.

The simplest usage of parsing is to identify errors in the structure, leading to an early aborting of the processing. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   if (!json_validate($json)) {
   	throw new Exception('invalid JSON data');
   }

.. _by-reference:

Passing By Reference
--------------------

When calling a method, or returning from it, data may be passed by value or by reference. 

By reference, a reference to the the data is passed : any modification on that value inside the method will be reflected in the original value. 

This is the alternative way of passing data to methods : the default way is to use by value, which copies the data. 

Passing by reference is the default behavior with object. Otherwise, it needs to be declared with the ``&`` operator, in the function signature.

Returned value are passed back to the calling context with the same rule than for parameters.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $a = 0;
   foo($a);  // displays 1
   print $a; // displays 1

.. _by-value:

Passing By Value
----------------

When calling a method, or returning from it, data may be passed by value or by reference. 

By value, a copy of the data is passed : any modification on that value inside the method will not be reflected in the original value. 

This is the default way of passing data to methods : the alternative way is to use by reference. 

Passing by value may be memory-intensive when passing a large array. This is not the case for objects, which are always passed by reference.

Returned value are passed back to the calling context with the same rule than for parameters.

PHPDoc is a style of PHP comments. Those comments are delimited by `/** */`. 

PHPdoc comments are different from the other styles of PHP comments in their syntax. They are also used for PHP annotations, and are sometimes confused with them. 

PHPDoc annotations are an adaptation of Javadoc for the PHP programming language. It is a formal way to comment specific PHP structures, that is machine readable.

PHPDoc has a special token, to make it easier to extract it from the code.

PHPdoc may be exploited by automated documentation tools, or static analyzer, IDE.

.. _phpinfo:

phpinfo()
---------

phpinfo() is one of the most famous PHP function. It outputs information about PHP's configuration, in HTML format. 

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   // Show all information, defaults to INFO_ALL
   phpinfo();
   ?>

.. _phpunit:

PHPunit
-------

PHPUnit is a popular open-source testing framework for the PHP programming language. It is designed to facilitate unit testing in PHP applications. Unit testing is a software testing approach where individual units or components of a software application are tested in isolation to ensure they behave as expected.

.. _pipeline:

Pipeline
--------

A pipeline is a chain of steps that composes a sequential set of actions.

A pipeline is used with : 
+ datasets, to read, transform and save data
+ continuous integration, where each check and packaging follows the previous one
+ processing, where each step is a separate process

The pipeline image is related to the assembly line, from factories.

.. _plugin:
.. _plug-in:

Plugin
------

A plugin is a component that add new features to an existing code. 

A plugin is build on top of a framework, and makes usage of it. It may also have its own dependencies.

Plugin is a generic term, and has many variations : component, extensions, module, etc.

.. _plus:

plus +
------

`+` is a native PHP operator, which has three usage : 

+ The addition, as in mathematics. This works on integers and double.
+ The merging of arrays. This merge sets the keys once, then omits the next values.
+ The + sign in front of a number, to make it explicitly positive. This is optional, and may be repeated.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $a = 1 + 2; // 3
   
   $b = [1, 2] + [3, 4, 5]; // [1,2, 5]
   
   ?>


`Documentation <https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.operators.arithmetic.php>`__

.. _polyfill:

Polyfill
--------

A polyfill is a piece of code that provides modern functionality on older browsers or environments that lack support for certain features. Polyfills are used to bridge the gap between the capabilities of modern web standards and the limitations of older browsers that might not fully support those standards.

The term "polyfill" is a combination of "poly" (meaning many) and "fill" (meaning to provide what's missing). Essentially, a polyfill "fills in" the missing functionality by replicating the behavior of the modern feature using JavaScript or other technologies, allowing developers to write code using modern APIs and standards without worrying about compatibility with older browsers.

There are polyfills for PHP version, for specific extensions (in case they are not compiled with PHP) or component versions.

There are polyfills available in packagist, like the family of packages ``symfony/polyfill-*``, or manually coded in the sources. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // hand-made polyfill
   if (!function_exists('str_contains')) {
   	function str_contains(string $a, string $b) : bool {
   		return substr($a, $b) !== false;
   	}
   }
   
   ?>

.. _portability:

Portability
-----------

Portability refers to the ability of a PHP codebase to run on different platforms or environments without requiring significant modifications. It means that the code can be easily transferred from one system to another, such as different operating systems or web servers, without encountering compatibility issues or breaking functionality.

The notion of portability is essential because PHP applications are often deployed on various platforms, like Windows, Linux, or macOS, and different web servers like Apache HTTP Server or Nginx. 

To ensure portability in PHP code, developers should follow best practices such as avoiding platform-specific functions, libraries, or configurations. Additionally, frameworks and libraries promote portability, such as Laravel or Symfony.

For example, some PHP functions are not available on Windows or Linux; Some extensions are not available on all platforms, such as `scoutapm` or `com`. Such non-portable features should not be used, or made optional in code for which portability is important. For example, the COM extension, or win32service extensions are available only on Windows; the extensions ev and eio are only available on Linux. When accessing files, both the / used by Linux, and \ used by Windows are supported, though it is recommended to use the /. 


.. _positional-parameter:

Positional Parameters
---------------------

Way of calling a function or method, where argument which are identified by their position in the signature or the call. This is the traditional way of sending arguments to a method. 

The alternative way is to use named parameters.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   function foo($a, $b) {
       return $a - $b;
   }
   
   echo foo(2, 3);  // return -1
   echo foo(3, 2);  // return 1
   
   echo foo(a: 2, b: 3);  // return -1
   echo foo(b: 2, a: 3);  // return 1
   
   ?>


`Documentation <https://www.php.net/manual/en/functions.arguments.php>`__

Related : :ref:`Named Parameters <named-parameter>`

.. _precedence:

Precedence
----------

Precedence organizes the way operators are executed, when they are mixed in the same expression.

For example, `1 + 2 * 3` will produce `7`, since `*` has a higher precedence than `+`. 

Every operator has a precedence, and when they have the same precedence, the rightmost one yield to the leftmost one.

Precedence offers some reading surprises to human readers. For example, `! $b instanceof \X` really applies `instanceof` first, and `&&` has a higher priority than `and`, even though they perform the same function.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   var_dump(!$b instanceof \X);
   var_dump($a = 1 and 2);
   
   ?>

.. _predefined-constant:

Predefined Constants
--------------------

Predefined constants are PHP native constants, available at the start of the PHP engine. 

Those constants are for internal usage, such as E_ALL, for error reporting, or STDOUT, for output. Some constants are providing information, such as PHP_VERSION's PHP version number. Others are meant to give a readable name to common values or arguments, such as DATE_RFC822. 

Other constants come from extensions : for example, the Math extension defines M_PI for the pi constant (3.14159...), libsodium defines SODIUM_CRYPTO_CORE_RISTRETTO255_SCALARBYTES, etc. Those are also predefined constants, although they depend on the compilation of PHP.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   echo "This is PHP ".PHP_VERSION;
   
   ?>


`Documentation <https://www.php.net/manual/en/reserved.constants.php>`__

Related : :ref:`Constants <constant>`

.. _prepared-query:

Prepared Query
--------------

A prepared query is a compiled query, where data are provided as parameters.

Instead of executing the query at once, the query is compiled first, and placeholders are filled later with the actual data. This prevents injections, as the data and the query are separated.

Most PHP DB extensions support prepared statements. Prepared statement may also be available with other systems than SQL databases, such as Gremlin server. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   // Example from PHP manual
   /* Execute a prepared statement by passing an array of values */
   $sth = $dbh->prepare('SELECT name, colour, calories
       FROM fruit
       WHERE calories < ? AND colour = ?');
   $sth->execute(array(150, 'red'));
   $red = $sth->fetchAll();
   $sth->execute(array(175, 'yellow'));
   $yellow = $sth->fetchAll();
   ?>

.. _preprocess:
.. _preprocessing:

Preprocessing
-------------

Preprocessing is an optimisation technique, where a value is calculated even before the execution of a script. This is only possible with constants values, which are known before execution.

Preprocessing may save execution time, and memory. 

In terms of maintenance, it hides some implementation details in the result : one has to guess where this value is coming from.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $seconds = 60;
   $minutes = 60;
   
   $hours = $seconds * $minutes;
   
   // this variable may be preprocessed, saving the calculation at execution time.
   $hours = 3600;
   
   ?>
   


`Documentation <https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.locale.php>`__

.. _print:

Print
-----

print() is a PHP language construct used to output text to the browser or the output stream. It is often used to display information to users on a web page or to debug and inspect variable values during development. The print construct can be used in two forms: with or without parentheses.

print() is a language construct of PHP. It only accepts one argument and it returns 1. 

print() also has a closely related function called print_r(), used for debugging. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   print 'Hello';
   
   print(' world!');
   
   ?>

.. _print_r:

print_r()
---------

print_r() is a built-in PHP function used for displaying the contents of an array or an object in a human-readable format. It's particularly helpful for debugging and understanding the structure of complex data structures in your PHP code. When you use print_r, it prints the array or object's values and structure to the browser or the console.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $a = 1;
   
   print_r($a);
   /*
   Array
   (
       [0] => 1
   )
   */
   
   ?>

.. _private:

Private Visibility
------------------

The private keyword is part of the three keywords to define visibility of a method, property or constant. It is the strictest level of visibility : it restrict usage to the current class only. Child class can't redefine it, nor access it.

The private keyword cannot be used with the final keyword : a private method is not visible in the child classes, and can't also be redefined.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class x {
       private const X = 1;
       
       final public function method() { 
           echo self::X;

.. _pcntl:

Process Control (pcntl)
-----------------------

Process Control is a set of native PHP function, that handles signals coming from the OS. 

pcntl is suited for CLI operations, and not for web serving operations. 

pcntl manage process creation, program execution, signal handling and process termination. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $pid = pcntl_fork();
   if ($pid == -1) {
        die('could not fork');
   } else if ($pid) {
        // we are the parent
        pcntl_wait($status); //Protect against Zombie children
   } else {
        // we are the child
   }

.. _promise:

Promise
-------

A promise is a programming construct used in asynchronous programming to handle the results or errors of an asynchronous operation that may not have completed yet. It allows you to write code that can continue executing while waiting for the completion of a long-running task, such as making an HTTP request or querying a database.

Promises follow the concept of promises in the context of the Promises/A+ specification, which is a widely adopted standard for asynchronous programming in many programming languages.

In PHP, promises are commonly used with libraries or frameworks that provide asynchronous functionality, such as Guzzle for making HTTP requests or ReactPHP for building asynchronous applications.

.. _promoted-property:

Promoted Properties
-------------------

Promoted properties are a class's arguments, which are declared as properties and automatically assigned their value at instantiation.

.. _property:

Properties
----------

Class properties are variables, local to an object or a class.

They might have visibility, chosen among : public (default), protected and private.

They might have a default value. By default it is null.

They might have a type, since PHP 7.4

They might be readonly, for properties which are only set once, and cannot be modified. 

They might be static, and not related to an object, but to a class. 

Property should be uniquely defined in a class. They may be redefined in children or parent when the visibility allows it.

.. _type-declaration-property:

Property Type Declaration
-------------------------

Type declaration property, also known as typed properties, is a feature introduced in PHP 7.4 that allows to specify the type of a class property. 

With type declaration properties, the type of a property is explicitly defined, ensuring that only values of the specified type can be assigned to that property. This helps enforce type safety and prevents accidental assignments of incompatible values.

Typed properties support any type format : simple, union, intersectional or DNF.

.. _protected:

Protected Visibility
--------------------

The protected keyword is part of the three keywords to define visibility of a method, property or constant. It is the strictest level of visibility : it restricts usage to the current class and its parents and children.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class x {
       protected const X = 1;
       
       public function method() {

Protocol
--------

A protocol is a scheme part of a URL, with an associated wrapper. 

In a URL like ``ftp://www.site.com/file.txt``, the protocol is ``ftp``, and relates to the FTP protocol. It is also a predefined PHP wrapper.

.. _public:

Public Visibility
-----------------

The `public` keyword is part of the three keywords to define visibility of a method, property or constant. It is the lowest level of visibility : it doesn't restrict usage.

`public` is also the default visibility when it is omitted. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class x {
   	// public constant
       const X = 1;

.. _random:

Random
------

Random generators generates numbers or strings. 

random_bytes(), random_int() and openssl_random_pseudo_bytes() produce pseudo-random data, suitable for cryptography. 

Traditional native functions, such as rand() and mt_rand() are not recommended for cryptography.

.. _readability:

Readability
-----------

A code is readable, or easy to read, if all the needed information is available in the code, without the need to reach for an extra piece of reference to understand it.

Readable code may be understood on the spot, while unreadable code hides some important part of the process. 

Readability is a human characteristic of the code : it depends on the level of knowledge of the reader. Good naming is an important part of readability, as intention are conveyed.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // all explicit alphabet
   $alphabet = array ( 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z');
   
   // readable with knowledge of range() function
   $alphabet = range('a', 'z');
   
   // generic name for a partial list of letter : many questions hang
   $array = range('a', 'l');

.. _readonly:

Readonly
--------

A property can be declared with the readonly modifier, which prevents modification of the property after initialization.

Readonly also applies inside the __clone() magic method : cloning doesn't allow for changing a readonly property.

In PHP 8.2, a class may be readonly, making all of of its properties readonly too. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class Test {
      public readonly string $prop;
   
      public function __construct(string $prop) {

.. _real:

Real Numbers
------------

Real numbers are represented using the ``float`` data type. 

They are also commonly referred to as ``floating-point numbers`` or ``double-precision numbers``. Floats are used to represent decimal numbers, including both whole numbers and fractions, with a certain degree of precision. Real numbers are used for performing mathematical calculations that require decimal accuracy.

There used to be ``real`` dedicated structures in PHP (like is_real() or (real)), though, they were removed in PHP 7.0. In case of doubt, refer to ``float``. 

It's important to be aware of potential rounding errors or precision issues when working with real numbers (floats) in PHP or any other programming language that uses floating-point representation. If you require exact decimal precision, you might need to use specialized libraries or techniques to handle arbitrary precision arithmetic.

.. _recursion:
.. _recursive:

Recursion
---------

Recursion in PHP is a method or a function, which calls itself. 

While the method calls itself, it also must have branch and not call itself : otherwise, the call will never end.

Functions, methods, closures and arrowfunctions may be recursive.

Recursion is an abstract notion : it is also used in the PHP name itself. PHP : Hypertext Preprocessor.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   function factorial(int $number) { 
       if ($number < 2) { 
           return 1; 
       }
   
       return ($number * factorial($number - 1)); 
   }
   
   // recursive closure
   $factorial = function( $n ) use ( &$factorial ) {
       if( $n == 1 ) return 1;
       return $factorial( $n - 1 ) * $n;

.. _refactoring:

Refactoring
-----------

Refactoring, in PHP as in any programming language, refers to the process of restructuring and improving the codebase of a PHP application without changing its external behavior. The primary goal of refactoring is to make the code more readable, maintainable, and efficient while reducing code duplication and potential bugs. Refactoring is an essential practice in software development to ensure that the code remains clean and adaptable as the project evolves. 

.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
   
   function factorial(int $n) : int {
   	$return = 2;

.. _reference-count:

Reference Count
---------------

Reference counting is the way PHP keeps track of the usage of a value.

The count starts at 1 when the value is created, and it is increased when the value is passed around. It is decreased when the value is deleted or modified. When the reference count is zero, the value may be removed from the memory safely. 

Reference counting is a feature of the PHP engine : code usually uses it transparently. The only possible interaction is when using the garbage collector.

.. _reference:

References
----------

References references allow to create multiple variables that refer to the same underlying value in memory. When using references, any changes made to one variable affect the others that reference the same value. This can be useful in certain situations, such as when you want to avoid copying large amounts of data or when you need to modify the original value through multiple variables.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $a = 1;
   
   $b = &$a; 
   $b = 2;
   
   echo $a;
   // displays 2

.. _reflection:

Reflection
----------

PHP reflection is a feature that allows to inspect and interact with the structure of classes, interfaces, methods, properties, and other elements of the code, during runtime. Reflection in PHP is made possible by the Reflection API, which provides a set of classes and functions for introspecting objects and classes.

PHP offers a complete API to describe classes, methods, interfaces, constants, functions, extensions, traits, enums and their components. 

+ ReflectionAttribute — The ReflectionAttribute class
+ ReflectionClass — The ReflectionClass class
+ ReflectionClassConstant — The ReflectionClassConstant class
+ ReflectionEnum — The ReflectionEnum class
+ ReflectionEnumBackedCase — The ReflectionEnumBackedCase class
+ ReflectionEnumUnitCase — The ReflectionEnumUnitCase class
+ ReflectionException — The ReflectionException class
+ ReflectionExtension — The ReflectionExtension class
+ ReflectionFiber — The ReflectionFiber class
+ ReflectionFunction — The ReflectionFunction class
+ ReflectionFunctionAbstract — The ReflectionFunctionAbstract class
+ ReflectionGenerator — The ReflectionGenerator class
+ ReflectionIntersectionType — The ReflectionIntersectionType class
+ ReflectionMethod — The ReflectionMethod class
+ ReflectionNamedType — The ReflectionNamedType class
+ ReflectionObject — The ReflectionObject class
+ ReflectionParameter — The ReflectionParameter class
+ ReflectionProperty — The ReflectionProperty class
+ ReflectionReference — The ReflectionReference class
+ ReflectionType — The ReflectionType class
+ ReflectionUnionType — The ReflectionUnionType class
+ ReflectionZendExtension — The ReflectionZendExtension class
+ Reflector — The Reflector interface

Reflection is also available in other programming languages.

ReflectionException is thrown whenever the Reflection API encounters an error.

Common reasons for encountering a ReflectionException include:

+ Class Not Found
+ Property Not Found
+ Method Not Found
+ Invalid Argument



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php

.. _register-globals:

Register Globals
----------------

Register globals is an old and removed feature of PHP, which automatically created variables from the incoming super globals, such as $_GET, $_POST, $_REQUEST, $_COOKIES. 

This meant that the initial set of variables in an application was not known, as they would depend on the incoming data. 

Register-globals has been removed in PHP 5.4. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   	// $_GET['foo'] = 'bar';
   	
   	echo $foo;
   	
   	// $_GET['_SESSION']['logged'] = '1';
   	
   ?>

.. _relative-types:

Relative Types
--------------

Relative types are types that are not explicit, but relative to the current class. There are three relative types : 

+ static : this represents the current calling class. It is important when the class is not directly called, but one of its children is. 
+ self : this represents the current class, at compilation time. 
+ parent : this represents the first available parent of the current class. It usually is the direct parent, but may skip classes when the requested resource is not available, as in method calls. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class x extends y {
   	function foo() : self {}
   	function hoo() : static {}
   	function ioo() : parent {}	
   }

.. _relaxed-comparison:
.. _loose-comparison:

Relaxed Comparison
------------------

In PHP, relaxed comparison, also known as loose comparison, is a comparison style that allows for non-strict equality checks between values. Relaxed comparison is performed using the double equals operator (==).

When using relaxed comparison (``==``), PHP will attempt to convert the operands to compatible types before comparing them. If the operands are of different types, PHP will perform type coercion to make them comparable.

Relaxed comparison is associated with ``==``, ``!=`` and ``<>``. It also applies to switch(), the spaceship operator ``<=>``, and the inegalities ``>``, ``<``, ``>=``, ``<=``. 

The contrary to relaxed comparison is the strict comparison, which includes type. 

Loose comparison is know to have changed significantly in PHP 8.0 : in particular, for special values like 0, empty string '', null and false.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   //true
   var_dump(1 == "1");
   //false
   var_dump(1 === "1");
   
   //false
   var_dump(1 > 'a');
   //true
   var_dump(1 < 'a');

.. _rpc:

Remote Procedure Call
---------------------

RPC is an acronym for Remote Procedure Call. This happens when the program delegate the execution of a piece of code to a separate server.

PHP offers xml-rpc, grpc, protocolbuffers and yar offers different standard way to do RPC.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php

.. _rfchange:

Request For Change
------------------

A Request For Change is a document containing a call for an adjustment of a source code.

PHP RFCs are formal proposals for changes or additions to the language. These proposals are used to discuss and decide on new features, syntax modifications, and improvements.

The RFC process allows the PHP community, which includes core developers and the broader user base, to review, comment on, and reach a consensus about proposed changes before they are implemented. This open and collaborative approach helps ensure that significant decisions are made with input from a diverse range of perspectives.

The typical lifecycle of an RFC involves several stages, including drafting, discussion, and voting. If an RFC is accepted and receives enough support, the proposed changes are integrated into the PHP source code, and the feature becomes part of a future PHP release

-----------------------

RFU stands for Reserved for Future Use. It means that the code is here for later usage, but not right now. Implicitly, it is a request to leave it in place, until actual usage happen.

.. _reserved-name:

Reserved Names
--------------

PHP shares several namespaces with the users, and has reserved some names for its own usage. 

+ Namespaces : the global namespace, also known as ``\`` is reserved for PHP.
+ Keywords : ``fn``, ``finally``, ``insteadof``, ``null``, ``void``, ...
+ classes, constants, functions, interfaces

.. _resource:

resource
--------

A resource is a special type of data, holding a reference to an external resource. Resources are created and used by special functions. 

Resources are only used with their dedicated functions. It is not possible to modify them in any other way.

Resources, in general, are being removed from PHP code and more recent versions tend to rely less on them and more on objects. 

There is a list of PHP resources available in the docs.

Return Type Will Change
-----------------------

This is a native PHP attribute, which tells the engine that method overwriting some native methods will change the returntype.

To avoid using that attribute, one must made the return type compatible with PHP signatures.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class Foo implements ArrayAccess {
       #[\ReturnTypeWillChange]

.. _return-typehint:
.. _returntype:

Return Typehint
---------------

Return typehints are the types used for the return values of a method or function. 

They are the same as the argument types, with a few addition : 

+ `void`, which means that no value is returned. (No usage of return, or return with no explicit value)
+ `never`, which means that the function won't return : either it will kill the application, or it will throw an exception.

Return types are ignored when the method throws an exception. 

return typehint are covariant : they get more or equally precise with each new child generation. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   function foo() : bool {
       if (rand(0,1)) {
           return true;

   <?php
   
   function foo() : int {
       return 1;

.. _scope:

Scope
-----

The scope is the context in which a variable is defined. A variable scope is usually its host method, or the file in which is used. It also extends to any included files, and skips other method definition.  

Arrow functions are initialised with the same scope than the defining scope, but do not write back in it. Closure with the use keyword also import variables from the defining scope. 

Scopes are generally considered as global or local. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
   
   // $a is defined in the file scope
   $a = 1;

Semantics is related with the meaning of things. In particular, when naming structures, such as variables, classes, methods, properties, goto labels, use alias, functions or constants, the name should be meaningful. 

While naming doesn't impact the code itself, as names are free, they do have a serious impact on human understanding of the code. 

It is also possible to find inconsistencies between the name and its usage. For example, when a name is used for an unexpected type. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   function foo(User $commenter) { }
   
   // Inconsistence between the parameter name and its type
   function bar(array $string) { }
   
   ?>


.. _semicolon:

Semicolon
---------

Semicolon is used to mark the end of a statement. 

It is also used in the for() statement, to separate the initialization, the termination and the increment. When using several statement between those semicolons, they must be separated with a comma.

Semicolons may also be used instead of colons, in a case statement.

Semicolons may be omitted, before a closing PHP tag.



.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
   
   $a = 1; $b = 2;
   
   // multi-statement usage in for()
   for($i = 0, $j = 0; $i < 10; ++$i, ++$j) {
   	print "$i $j\n";
   }
   
   switch($a) {
   	case 1;
   		$a = 2;
   		break;
   		
   	default; 
   		$a = 1;
   }
   
   // semi colon may be omitted before the closing tag.
   $c = 1
   ?>

.. _sensitiveparameter:

Sensitive Parameter
-------------------

This is a native PHP attribute, which tells the engine that a parameter is a sensitive parameter, and should not be displayed by PHP when an error displays the stack trace.

This prevent innocent mistakes, where reading the logs on the production server also tells the actual value of a secret.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   function foo(
       #[SensitiveParameter] string $apiKey
   ): int {
       throw new Exception('Could not foo');
   }
   
   foo('abc');
   
   /* The code above displays the following : 
   
   Fatal error: Uncaught Exception: Could not foo in file.php:6
   Stack trace:
   #0 file.php(9): foo(Object(SensitiveParameterValue))
   #1 {main}
     thrown in file.php on line 6
   */
   
   ?>

.. _serialization:
.. _serialize:

Serialization
-------------

Serialization refers to the process of converting a data structure or object into a format that can be easily stored, transmitted, or reconstructed later. In other words, it involves converting complex data, such as objects or data structures, into a linear sequence of bytes or characters that can be saved to a file, sent over a network, or otherwise persisted.

Serialization is commonly used in computer science and software development for various purposes, such as:

+ Data Storage: Serialized data can be saved to files or databases, allowing it to be retrieved and reconstructed at a later time.
+ Data Transmission: Serialized data can be sent over a network or communication channel, allowing it to be transmitted between different systems or processes.
+ Caching: Serialized data can be stored in memory caches, improving the performance of applications by reducing the need to regenerate complex data structures.
+ Remote Procedure Calls (RPC): Serialized data can be used to pass function arguments and return values between remote systems or services.
+ Message Queues: Serialized data can be placed in message queues to enable communication between different components or microservices.
+ State Persistence: Serialized data can represent the state of an application, enabling it to be saved and restored across different sessions.

Common serialization formats include JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), XML (eXtensible Markup Language), Protocol Buffers, and MessagePack, among others. Each format has its own characteristics, advantages, and use cases. The choice of serialization format often depends on factors such as data complexity, performance requirements, interoperability, and ease of use.

Deserialization, also known as unserialization, is the reverse process, where the serialized data is converted back into its original form, such as objects or data structures, so that it can be used and manipulated within a program.

In PHP, there are different ways to implement serialization. The native way is to rely on the serialize() and unserialize(), which, in turn, rely on the __serialize() and __unserialize() magic method. Then, var_export() and require() make another serialization method. WDDX, XML, JSON or YAML all work as serialization, yet they usually are not considered, over speed or performance issues. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class X {
       private const X = 1;
       
       function foo() {
           // same as \X::C;
           return self::C;
       }
   }
   
   ?>

.. _session:

Session
-------

Session support in PHP consists of a way to preserve certain data across subsequent accesses.

It relies on the ``session_*`` functions, and the ``$_SESSION`` superglobal variable.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   if (isset($_SESSION['x'])) {
       print "x was already set with the value ".$_SESSION['x'];
   }
   
   $_SESSION['x'] = rand(0, 10);
   print "Giving the value ".$_SESSION['x']." to x, in the session\n";
   
   ?>

.. _shallow-clone:

Shallow Clone
-------------

A shallow clone is an object cloning, where the cloned object keeps the same object properties as the original object. This is a fast way to share data between objects.

Shallow cloning is the default behavior in PHP.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class Dog {
       private $name = '';
       private Address $address;
   
       function __construct(string $name, Address $address) {
           $this->address->setName($address);
       }
       
       function moves(string $address) {
           $this->address->setName($address);
       }
   
       // no __clone method
   }
   
   $spike = new Dog('Spike', new Address('Acme city'));
   $medor = clone $spike;
   $medor->moves('Upstate farm');
   
   // spike and medor are still at the same address
   
   ?>

.. _short-assignation:
.. _combined-operator:

Short Assignations
------------------

In addition to the basic assignment operator, there are "combined operators" for all of the binary arithmetic, array union and string operators that allow you to use a value in an expression and then set its value to the result of that expression.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // incrementing $a by one
   $a = $a + 1;
   
   // short assignement for the above syntax
   $a += 1;
   
   ?>

Related : :ref:`Assignations <assignation>`, :ref:`Assignations <assignement>`

.. _short-syntax:

Short Syntax
------------

A short syntax is the fusion of an operator with the `=` operator. That way, the operator is applied to the right hand operand, and the left variable, then, assigned to that variable. 

It is convenient when the variable has to be assigned again to itself.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $a = 0;
   // Adds 2 to $a
   $a = $a + 2;
   
   // short syntax to add 3 to $a
   $a += 3;
   
   ?>

.. _short-tag:
.. _short-open-tag:

Short Tags
----------

PHP uses special tags to identify code that has to be executed. The short tags are a special set of PHP tag, shorter than the usual ``<?php``. It was simply ``<?``.

Short tags may be disabled in PHP configuration, with the ``short_open_tag`` directive. 

Short tags are different from echo tags : those tags immediately display data.

From the manual : As short tags can be disabled it is recommended to only use the normal tags (<?php ?> and <?= ?>) to maximise compatibility. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   echo 1;
   ?>
   
   <? 
   // this is a short tag
   echo 2;
   
   ?>

.. _short-ternary:
.. _short-ternary-operator:

Short Ternary Operator
----------------------

The expression ``(expr1) ?: (expr3)`` evaluates to ``expr2`` if ``expr1`` evaluates to empty(), and ``expr3`` if ``expr1`` evaluates to false.

Is is a short version of the ternary operator, and it is often used to set default values in a concise way.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $action = (empty($_POST['action'])) ? 'default';
   
   ?>

.. _shutdown-function:
.. _shutdown-handler:

Shutdown Function
-----------------

The shutdown function is a PHP custom function which is called when the application is shutting down. This is after a call to exit(), die() or the natural end of life of the script.

Multiple functions may be registered with the register_shutdown_function() function. They will be called in order of registration.

Shutdown function acts as destructors : they should clean up any unfinished jobs, and gracefully free resources, such as closing files with their correct endings, or gracefully closing connections.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   // extract from the PHP manual
   function shutdown()
   {
       // This is our shutdown function, in 
       // here we can do any last operations
       // before the script is complete.
   
       echo 'Script executed with success', PHP_EOL;
   }
   
   register_shutdown_function('shutdown');
   ?>

.. _signature:

Signature
---------

The signature of a method or a function is the list of arguments and constraints that applies when calling it. 

In its simplest form, signature of a method is its name, its argument's type and list, though modern syntax also include default values, visibilities, attributes and parameter names.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   function foo(string &$s = 'abc') {}
   
   ?>
   


`Documentation <https://www.php.net/manual/en/functions.arguments.php>`__

.. _silent:

Silent Behavior
---------------

Silent behaviors are expressions that do not raise any error, and are impossible or useless.

Silent behaviors also describes extra actions that are taken by PHP, without signaling it or making it obvious.

Since they are silent, their usage or absence of usage is never signaled and the code may stay in the repository long before being discovered and removed or fixed.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // Importing a non existent class
   use Unknown\Namespace\theClass;
   
   // Typing with a non-existent class, or a trait, but still allowing other types
   function foo(UndefinedType|string $t) : \aTrait|string {}
   
   // The whole try catch is now useless.
   try {
   
   } catch (unknownException $e) {}
   
   // null is automatically turned into an int, so 0
   $a = [null => 1];
   echo $a[0]; // displays 1
   
   ?>


.. _sql:

Simple Query Language (SQL)
---------------------------

Simple Query Language is a database query language, use to access and update data in a a relational database management system (RDBMS).

PHP supports several rdbms natively, such as : Mysql, Oracle, IBM db2, DBA, ODBC. PHP also offers a database abstraction layer, called PDO. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   mysqli_report(MYSQLI_REPORT_ERROR | MYSQLI_REPORT_STRICT);
   $mysqli = new mysqli("example.com", "user", "password", "database");
   
   $mysqli->query("DROP TABLE IF EXISTS test");

.. _simple-switch:

Simple Switch
-------------

A simple switch is a switch where all the cases are simple literals. This helps PHP optimize the command and finds the correct case immediately, instead of checking them one by one. 

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   switch ($i) {
       case 0:
           echo "i equals 0";
           break;
       case 1:
           echo "i equals 1";
           break;

.. _single-page-application:

Single Page Application
-----------------------

SPA's a web application or website that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current page, rather than loading entire new pages from the server. This approach provides a smoother and more fluid user experience, as the page doesn't need to be fully reloaded for every interaction. SPAs often use JavaScript frameworks like htmx, React, Angular, or Vue.js to handle these dynamic updates and manage the application state.

.. _single-quote:

Single Quotes Strings
---------------------

Single quoted strings are strings that include a literal value. 

This is an simpler version of the double-quoted strings. 

It is possible to include variables `$var`, single-dimension arrays `$array[1]` or `$array[index]`, and single-dereferencing object members `$object->member`. More complex expressions require usage of curly braces `{$}`, or the usage of the dot operator.

Double quoted strings use the anti-slash `\` to escape special characters, such as the anti-slash and the `$` sign.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // single quoted string : all literal values
   $name = 'elephpant loves $signs.'; 
   
   // double quoted string : variable value will be replaced at execution time.
   $greeting = "Hello! $name"; 
   
   // identical to
   $greeting = 'Hello! '.$name;

Single Responsability Principle
-------------------------------

Single Responsability Principle is a coding principle where one component is responsible for one task, and nothing more. 

It particularly aims at avoid multiple responsabilities in code, where several tasks are performed at the same time. This means that any modifications to that method has an impact on each of the tasks, leading to potential spillovers. 

Single Responsability Principile relies on the possibility to identify one responsability per component, and exclude any other.

.. _singleton:

Singleton
---------

A singleton is a class which can only have one object. There is no way to instantiate the class and get a second, distinct object.

A singleton is used when there is a significant cost or limitations at maintaining multiple instances of the same object. For example, multiple ``Sqlite3`` access to the same file, even as read-only, means several copies of the same file in memory. Or, several object referencing the same lock may be a problem.

Singleton are more difficult to test, as there is only one instance, and it is difficult to control it. Singleton may be achieve by dependency injection, with the same object. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
   // One method to build a singleton class
   class Singleton {
     private static self $instance = null;
     
     // The constructor is private, to avoid multiple instantiation
     // it is still accessible indirectly, via a public static method. 
     private function __construct()
     {
       // the usual constructo code
     }
   
     // the factory to build the singleton 
     public static function getInstance() : self {
       if (self::$instance === null) {
         self::$instance = new self;
       }
    
       return self::$instance;

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $server = socket_create(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, SOL_TCP);

.. _sort:
.. _sorting:

Sort
----

Sorting is the action to put a list of object into a specific order. In PHP, sorting applies to arrays.

There are several ways to sort arrays in PHP: by value (no prefix), by key (`k` prefix), or by value while keeping the keys (`a` prefix, for associative). 

Then, the sort may be ascending (no prefix), descending (`r`, as in reverse) or custom (`u`, as in user sort). Custom sort is done with a closure or similar.

Based on the prefixes above, the following PHP native functions are available : sort(), rsort(), usort(), ksort(), krsort(), uksort(), asort(), uasort(). There is not ursort(), as the reverse part of the sort may be coded in the custom closure.

In case of ex-aequos while sorting, which are values with the same order, the values are sorted in the same order than the original array. This behavior has changed in PHP 7.0.

It is also possible to sort using a natural sort, which is a way to sort strings like a human would read them : natsort().

The default comparison between elements may be adapted with sort()'s parameter : regular, numeric, string, locale, natural and with or without case.  



.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
   
   $fruits = array( "Orange1", "orange2", "Orange3", "orange20" );
   sort($fruits, SORT_NATURAL | SORT_FLAG_CASE);
   foreach ($fruits as $key => $val) {
       echo "fruits[" . $key . "] = " . $val . "\n";

.. _spaceship:

Spaceship Operator
------------------

Spaceship operator is an operator which reports if a value is larger, equal or smaller than another value. It return 1, 0 or -1 in each case, respectively. 

The spaceship operator may be replace by a `-` (minus) sign, if the compared values are correct. It may also be replace with `!=`, since -1 and 1 are both cast to `true`. 

The spaceship operator got its name from its resemblance to an flying saucer. Battleship operator, or death star operator do not exist.

.. _special-typehint:

Special Typehints
-----------------

PHP defines some special typehints.

+ mixed : any type
+ void : no returned value
+ callable : may be used as a callback
+ iterable : may be used with foreach(), including array
+ never : never returns
+ object : object of any class
+ parent : any of the parent class of the current class, excluding it
+ self : the current class
+ static : the current called class

Other special types are the scalar types. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   function foo(iterable $i) : never {
       foreach ($i as $j) {
           echo $j;
       }
   
       die();
   }

.. _sprintf:
.. _vprintf:
.. _printf:

sprintf
-------

sprintf() is a PHP native function, which format a string based on a format string, and one or more values. 

sprintf() returns the formatted string, while printf() displays it immediately, and vprintf() writes the formatted string to a stream. There is also sscanf(), which parse the string, according to the format.

printf() is convenient to display text in command line, as it makes easy to use fillers and justification. 

printf() also supports named arguments, which makes the format string more flexible. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // displays 123 with 9 characters, and fills with dots any empty characters
   // ......123
   echo sprintf("%'.9d\n", 123);
   
   // same as above, without the echo command
   printf("%'.9d\n", 123);
   
   // same as above, without the echo command
   vprintf("%'.9d\n", '......123');
   
   ?>

.. _sql-injection:

SQL injection
-------------

A SQL injection is a vulnerability, where external data are used to change the behavior of a SQL query. 

In the example below, `$_GET` are directly used inside the query. By using a clever string (shown in comment), it is possible to bypass the whole condition and get access to any user. 

Among the solutions to mitigate this problem : filter adequately the incoming data; use prepared statements. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
   
   // $_GET['name'] = '" OR 1 = 1 OR "';
   $SQL_query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name=\\".$_GET['name']."\\" AND password=\".$_GET['pass']."\"";
   
   $connexion->query($SQL_query);
   
   ?>

.. _view-sql:

SQL Views
---------

Views in a SQL server is a virtual table, build as the result of a SQL query.

Instead of accessing a concrete table, a view is built as a SELECT query, and display the result of that query. As a SELECT, it may join with multiple tables, display columns, build dynamic values, and drop others.

SQL views are usually non-writable (no UPDATE, no INSERT), as they do not mirror a real table.

.. _sqlite:

Sqlite3
-------

SQLite is a C-language library that implements a small, fast, self-contained, high-reliability, full-featured, SQL database engine.

The related extension is Sqlite3. It allows the creation and usage of file-based or memory-based databases.

Sqlite3 is also available with PDO (Portable Document File), with the pdo_sqlite engine.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   $db = new SQLite3('my.sqlite3');
   
   $results = $db->query('SELECT bar FROM foo');
   while ($row = $results->fetchArray()) {
       var_dump($row);
   }
   ?>

.. _ssl:

SSL
---

SSL, the Secure Sockets Layer, is a cryptographic protocol designed to provide communications security over a computer network and on the Web. SSL is often related to HTTPS, for secured transmission with the HTTP protocol, although HTTPS has moved from SSL to TLS.

SSL is a PHP context for sockets, and share the configuration options with TLS.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $context = stream_context_create( array( 'ssl' => ['local_cert'=> $certificate_path], )));
   
   if ($fp = stream_socket_client('ssl://'.$host.':'.$port, $errno, $errstr, 30, STREAM_CLIENT_CONNECT, $context)) {
       fwrite($fp, "\n");
   } else {

   }
   
   ?>

.. _standalone-types:

Standalone types
----------------

Types are standalone, as they can be use alone, in a type declaration. This is the case of almost any type of PHP, scalar, or class. The only exception used to be false and null.

Null needed to be associated to another type, and was not standalone. False also was introduced as a non-standalone type, where it had to be associated with another type. 

Since PHP 8.2 (and 8.3 for true), those types are now standalone and can be used by themselves. They are also called a 'literal type' as they define both the type and the value. 

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   function foo(true $t) {
   	// $t can only be true
   	var_dump($t);
   }
   
   ?>

.. _spl:

Standard PHP Library (SPL)
--------------------------

The Standard PHP Library (SPL) is a collection of interfaces and classes that are meant to solve common problems.

SPL offers features, functions, classes and interfaces in many different fields : iterators, data structures, files, exceptions, and observers. 

One of the most famous SPL features is the function spl_autoload_register(), which register an autoload handler.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // SPL and autoloading
   spl_autoload_register(function ($class) {
       include 'classes/' . $class . '.class.php';
   });
   
   if ($object instanceof Countable) {
       $count = count($object);
   } elseif ($object instanceof Traversable)
       $count = iterator_count($object);
   } else {
       print "Can't count this";
   }
   
   ?>

.. _stateless:

Stateless
---------

Stateless refers to a system or protocol that does not retain information about the previous interactions or states of users or devices. In a stateless system, each transaction or request is treated as an independent and isolated event, and the system does not store any information about the context or history of those interactions. This design is often used in computer networking, web development, and distributed systems.

See also `PHP is Weird, Stateless, and Beautiful <https://fideloper.com/php-weird-stateless-and-beautiful>`_

.. _statement:

Statement
---------

A statement can be an assignment, a function call, a loop, a conditional statement or even a statement that does nothing (an empty statement). 

Statements usually end with a semicolon. 

In addition, statements can be grouped into a statement-group by encapsulating a group of statements with curly braces. A statement-group is a statement by itself as well.

.. _static:

static
------

The ``static`` keyword has several distinct usages.

Static is one of the three special keywords that are used to access properties or methods from inside the class definition. It relates to the current called class.

Static is a keyword for methods and properties : they are turned into class elements, and should be reached with the :: syntax, instead of -> or ?->.

Static is a keyword for closures and arrow functions : it prevents the current scope to be included in with the closure, thus limiting the number of accessible values.

Static is a keyword for variables : those variables aren't removed at the end of the method execution and are available at the beginning of the next call.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class X {
       private const X = 1;
       
       function foo() {
           return static::1;
   
           // same as \X::C; when the object is of class X
           // same as \Y::C; when the object is of class W
       }
   }
   
   class Y extends X {
       private const X = 2;
   }
   
   ?>

.. _class-constant:
.. _static-constant:
.. _interface-constant:
.. _trait-constant:
.. _enum-constant:

Static constant
---------------

Static constants are constants that are defined inside a class, interface, trait (since PHP 8.2) and enumeration. 

Static constants have a visibility. Visibility may be ``public``, ``protected``, ``private``. By default, and for backward compatibility, a constant without a visibility is ``public``.

Static constants may also be overwritten by children classes. They can also use the ``final`` keyword, to avoid such behavior.

Static constants are defined at coding time, and cannot be changed later, not dynamically created. 

Static constant syntax is the same than for enumeration cases. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class x {
       public  const FOO = 1;
       private const BAR = 2;
   }
   
   ?>

.. _static-method:

Static Method
-------------

Static methods are methods defined with the static keyword. They have to be called with the name of the class, rather than instantiated object. 

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class x {
       static function foo() {
           echo __METHOD__;
       }
   }
   
   //displays x::foo
   x::foo();

Static Property
---------------

Static properties are properties defined with the static keyword. They may be accessed with the name of the class, or instantiated object. 

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class x {
       static $p = 1;
   }
   
   //displays x::foo
   print x::$p;
   $object = new x;

.. _static-variable:

Static Variables
----------------

A static variable is a variable that retains its value across multiple function calls. Unlike regular variables, which are created and destroyed each time a function is called, static variables are initialized only once and persist throughout the entire execution of the script. 

To declare a static variable in PHP, you need to use the static keyword inside a function. 

Static variables are commonly used when you want to keep track of certain information across function calls without the need to use global variables or properties. They are especially useful for counters, accumulators, caching, and memoization. However, it's essential to use them judiciously and avoid excessive reliance on them, as they can make code harder to maintain and understand if used indiscriminately.

Static variables may be refactored as a global variable or a property. 

Static variables may be declared only once, starting with PHP 8.3. Until that version, it is a best practice to only declare them once.

Static variables may use any PHP expressions to define their default value. That value is used when the variable is used for the first time. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   function counter() {
       static $count = 0;
       
       return ++$count;
   }
   
   counter(); // print 1
   counter(); // print 2
   
   ?>

.. _stdclass:

stdclass
--------

Stdclass is a native PHP class. It is the class used when a generic object is created, for example with json_decode() or the (object) cast operator.

The stdClass is allowed to create dynamic properties on the fly, as its base definition has none. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class X {
       private $property = 1;
       
       function foo() {
           // dynamic property
           $this->a = 1;
           
           // dynamic property with variable name 
           $b = "abc";
           $this->$b = 1; 
           
           // static property
           $this->property = 1;
       }
   }

.. _storage-system:

Storage systems
---------------

A storage system is a generic term to describe an external service that store data for a longer time than the current PHP request. 

Storage systems may be RDBMS (SQL servers), key-value stores, noSQL server, file system, memory caching system, etc.


Related : :ref:`RDBMS <rdbms>`, :ref:`Key-value stores <key-value-store>`

.. _stream:

Stream
------

Streams are a generalisation of the notion of files. Just like files, they can be opened, read, written and closed. 

Unlike files, they may be a lot of things : archive, compressed data, sockets, other programs, etc. They also may not support all the range of features of files.

PHP offers native functions to create, configure, filter streams and process their data.

Streams may be extended with the notion of wrapper and protocols.



.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
   
   if ($stream = fopen('https://www.php.net', 'r')) {
       // print the first 100 chars of the HTML page.
       echo stream_get_contents($stream, -1, 100);

.. _strict-comparison:

Strict Comparison
-----------------

Strict comparison is a comparison operator or a control structure that checks not only the value but also the type of the value. In other words, it does not apply any type-juggling to the values before processing. 

Here are the strict operators : ``==`` may be replaced with ``===``,  ``!=`` may be replaced with ``!==``, ``switch`` may be replaced with ``match``, in_array() with the third parameter ``strict`` set to true. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   //true
   var_dump(1 == "1");
   //false
   var_dump(1 === "1");
   
   //true
   var_dump(null == 0);
   //false
   var_dump(null === 0);

.. _strict_types:

strict_types
------------

strict_types is an execution directive, that makes PHP more strict when applying the typehints. In particular, it doesn't cast values automatically, but raise an error. 

``strict_types`` is an option per file, and is set with the declare() function.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   declare(strict_types=1);
   
   function foo(int $a) {}
   
   foo(1);
   foo(1.3);
   //Fatal error: Uncaught TypeError: foo(): Argument #1 ($a) must be of type int, float given,

.. _string:

String
------

A string is series of characters, where a character is the same as a byte. This means that PHP only supports a 256-character set, and hence does not offer native Unicode support. 

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $string = 'Hello world';
   
   ?>

.. _string-interpolation:

String Interpolation
--------------------

String interpolation is a feature where variables inside a string are dynamically replaced by their value at execution time. 

There are several ways to do interpolation : 

+ use double-quotes and a variable
+ use double-quotes and a property or a array with a valid index
+ use curly braces with a variable
+ use dollar and curly-braces : it calls the variable whose name is dynamically calculated in the curly braces. This syntax is deprecated in PHP 8.2 and later.

Double quotes and Heredoc notation allows string interpolation. On the other hand, single quote and nowdoc forbid interpolation. Then, escaping the special characters such as `$` and `{` with `\\\\` also disables interpolation locally.

Interpolation happens inside strings, while concatenation happens between strings.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $world = 'world';
   // This is an interpolated string
   $string = "Hello $world";
   
   // This is not an interpolated string
   $string = 'Hollow $world';
   
   ?>

.. _stringable:

Stringable
----------

Stringable is a type, which represents variables that may be used as as string : either a string, a heredoc or a string constant; or an object which has the `__toString()` method.

Stringable is automatically added to any class (and subclass) that has the `__toString()` method, though it is recommended to add it explicitly.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   function foo(stringable $s) {
   	print $s;
   }
   
   ?>

.. _strpos-syndrom:

Strpos() Syndrom
----------------

The strpos() syndrom is a classic bug : strpos() searches for a string inside another string. It reports its index upon finding it, or false, if the string was not found.

PHP's string are indexed starting with 0, so the found string might be in an index from 0 to the size of the string. 

PHP also cast 0 to false. And false is also the value that is returned when the string is not found. So, if the found string is at the very beginning of the searched string, it might be confused for its absence.

To avoid confusion, it is recommended to make an explicit comparison with false, using ``===`` or ``!==``.

Note that many PHP native functions behave that way, and should be treated with the same precaution.

In the case of strpos(), it may be replaced with str_contains() (since PHP 8.0) or a regex, to get safer results.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $haystack = 'abcdef';
   
   if (strpos($haystack, 'b')) {
   	print "The haystack contains a 'b'\n";
   }
   
   if (strpos($haystack, 'a')) {
   	print "The haystack contains an 'a'\n";
   } else {
   	print "The haystack doesn't contain an 'a'\n";
   }
   
   
   ?>

.. _stubs:

Stubs Files
-----------

Stubs files are PHP code, that contains only the definitions of classic PHP structures (functions, constants, classes, interfaces), without any actual code. They only provide the definitions.

Stubs files are also used for PHP code templates : they are mostly made of PHP code, with placeholders, for later generations. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $a = 0; // $a is getting overwritten
   $array = extract(['a' => 1, 'b' => 2]);

.. _superglobal:
.. _super-global:

Superglobal Variables
---------------------

PHP superglobal variables are predefined variables that are accessible from any scope within a PHP script without the need for any special syntax or function calls. These variables are called 'superglobals' because they are automatically available in all scopes, including functions, methods, and the global scope.

PHP provides several superglobal variables, each serving a specific purpose. Here are the most commonly used ones:

    $_SERVER: Contains information about the server and execution environment, such as headers, paths, and script locations.

    $_GET: Holds the values of variables passed to the current script via the URL parameters (HTTP GET method).

    $_POST: Stores the values of variables sent to the current script via HTTP POST method (usually from an HTML form).

    $_REQUEST: Contains the values of both $_GET, $_POST, and $_COOKIE variables, providing a convenient way to access user input data.

    $_COOKIE: Holds the values of cookies sent by the client browser to the server.

    $_SESSION: Stores and retrieves session variables, which are used to persist data across multiple requests from the same user.

    $_FILES: Contains information about uploaded files through an HTML form with enctype="multipart/form-data".

    $_ENV: Holds variables passed to the PHP script from the server's environment.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   global $x;
   $x = "A";
   
   function counter() {
       echo $GLOBALS['A'];

.. _supply-chain-attack:

Supply Chain Attack
-------------------

Supply Chain Attack is a security attack that uses dependencies to infect a program.

Modern applications are built on top of components which are fetched from central repositories. In the PHP world, composer is the most popular PHP repository.

When those external repositories are infected with malicious component or code, the dependency manager loads them like the rest of the code. Blind trust in the imported code lead to vulnerabilities.

Support Vector Machine
----------------------

SVM stands for Support Vector Machine. It is the name of a machine learning algorithm which classify data by taking into account n dimensions. 

The algorithm looks for a way to distinguish two sets, by using those nth dimensions. 

PHP supports SVM with the ext/svm extension and `rubix/ml` package.

SVMException
------------

The SVMException exception is thrown by the SVM::train() method. It happens when the model could not be trainted. 

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   $svm = new SVM();
   try {
   	$model = $svm->train($data);
   } catch (SVMException $e) {
   	print $e->getMessage();

.. _svn:

SVN
---

SVN, or Subversion, is a version control system (VCS) used for managing and tracking changes to files and directories in software development and other collaborative environments. It allows multiple users to work on the same set of files, keeping track of changes, and maintaining a history of who made what changes and when. Subversion is commonly used for source code management, but it can also be used for versioning other types of documents and data.

.. _swap:

SWAP
----

Swap may be two things : 

+ Memory, stored on the disk. 
+ The operation to exchange 2 things, one for another. For example, variable swap, which exchange their value.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php

.. _switch:
.. _endswitch:

Switch
------

The ``switch`` expression branches evaluation based on an equality check of a value. It also handles a ``default`` case, when none of the explicit cases match.

Each case is an expression, and shall be used that way. 

``switch`` use a relaxed comparison between the parametered value and the case values. This means that some type juggling happens, and some literals might behave as identical.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $b = 1;
   switch ($i) {
       case 0:
           echo 'i equals 0';
           break;
       case 1:
           echo 'i equals 1';
           break;
       case $b + 1:
           echo 'i equals '.($b + 1);
           break;
       default:
       	echo 'i is none of the expected values.';
   }
   
   switch (false) {
       case null:
       	// false == null so this is the case
           echo 'This is null';
           break;
       case '':
           echo 'This is empty string';

.. _switch-case:

Switch Case
-----------

A switch case, also called case, is an option in a switch() or a match() expression. 

In a switch(), several cases may be used in a row, to apply the same code. This is not possible with match().

In a switch(), the case's code is executed until the end of the switch(), or a break command. A case that uses its own code, and the following case's code is called a fallthrough. 

There is a default case, which is called when all other cases fail.

In the event of multiple identical cases, the first one is used. PHP adapts the type of the values while looking for the right case.


.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
   
   switch($x) {
   	case 'a':
   	case 'c':
   		$a = 1;
   		// fall through
   		
   	case 'b' :
   		$a =2;
   		break 1;
   		
   	// default case, when $x is not 'a' 'b' or 'c'
   	default :
   		$a = 3;
   }
   
   ?>

.. _switch-default:

Switch Default
--------------

A switch default, also called default, is the catch-all option in a switch() or a match() expression. 

In a switch(), the default case may be stacked with other cases, to apply the same code. This is not possible with match().



.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
   
   switch($x) {
   	case 'a':
   	default:
   		$a = 1;

.. _fallthrough:

Switch Fallthrough
------------------

A fallthrough is the absence of break (or equivalent) at the end of a switch case. That way, the execution continues on the next case. 

While this is an intended feature, and is useful to reduce code, it tends to surprise programmers, which expect the cases to always end. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   switch ($a) {
       case 1:
           $a = 2 * $a;
           // fallthrough here : the execution continue
           
       case 2:
           $a = $a + 1;

.. _system-call:

System Call
-----------

A system call is a call to an operating system function. In PHP, those are done with the shell_exec(), system() and exec() functions; and the `` (back tick) operators.

   <?php
   
   // list files
   $list = shell_exec('ls -1');

.. _system-event:

System Event
------------

System events, also known as signals, are software interrupts sent to a program to indicate that an important event has occurred. 

By default, PHP reacts to system events. It may also handle those events by configuring a handler the pcntl_signal() function.

.. _task-runner:

Task Runner
-----------

A task runner refers to a tool or framework that automates repetitive tasks, such as building, testing, and deploying PHP applications. It helps streamline development workflows by reducing manual effort and increasing efficiency.

Task runners provide a way to define and execute tasks or scripts in a predefined sequence, often using configuration files or scripts. These tasks can include various activities, such as compiling code, running tests, optimizing assets, generating documentation, and deploying the application to a server.

.. _tcp:

TCP
---

TCP, which stands for Transmission Control Protocol, is one of the main protocols in the Internet Protocol (IP) suite. Together with IP (Internet Protocol), it forms the foundation for Internet communication. TCP is a connection-oriented protocol, meaning it establishes a reliable and secure connection between two devices before data is exchanged.

Key features of TCP include:

+ Reliability: TCP ensures the reliable delivery of data by using acknowledgments and retransmission. When a device sends data over a TCP connection, it waits for an acknowledgment from the receiving device. If an acknowledgment is not received, the data is resent.

+ Connection-oriented: Before data transfer begins, a connection must be established between the sender and the receiver. This connection is maintained until the data transfer is complete, and then it is terminated.

+ Flow control: TCP includes mechanisms for flow control, which helps manage the amount of data sent between devices to prevent congestion and ensure efficient communication.

+ Error checking: TCP includes error-checking mechanisms to detect and retransmit lost or corrupted data. This contributes to the protocol's reliability.

+ Sequencing: TCP numbers each data packet so that the receiving device can reorder them and ensure that the data is delivered in the correct order.

TCP is commonly used for applications that require high reliability and accurate delivery of data, such as web browsing, file transfers, and email. It operates at the transport layer of the OSI model and works in conjunction with the Internet Protocol (IP), which operates at the network layer. Together, TCP/IP provides a robust and standardized framework for communication over the Internet.

--------

A template is a preset document, filled with values in placeholders, to display the resulting data. This is also called a view.

PHP used to be known as a template engine. Nowadays, template engines are written in PHP. 

Templates may be produced in any file format : HTML, CSS, Javascript, JSON, PDF, URL, etc. 

Template may be large : they are then broken down into smaller and reusable sub-templates.

Some template packages : Twig, Latte, Blade, smarty.

.. _test:

Test
----

Tests are tools that monitor the behavior of a code. The code should produce the expected results that are provided in the tests.

There are many different types of tests : 

+ Unit test : close to the class level of the code
+ Integration test : they check that components collaborate nicely
+ Functional tests : close to the specifications and the business level
+ End-to-end tests : they run the software from beginning to the end
+ Performance tests : tests focusing on the behavior of the software under load
+ Acceptance tests : the tests that the software must pass to be accepted by the end user
+ Smoke tests : tests that quickly detect a problem in the software. They are the most obvious. 
+ Exploratory tests : when tests are used to check new behavior of the code
+ Regression tests : tests that ensures that previous behaviors are still behaving the same
+ Fuzzing : testing the software with random data

Tests may be manual, when they are executed manually. Those are not recorded. Test may be automated, when they are executed by another piece of software. 

PHP has several testing framework : PHPunit, pest, pint, simpletest, atoum.

Tests are often further automated in a Continuous Integration Pipeline.

.. _test-data-provider:

Test Data Provider
------------------

.. _test-pyramid:

Test Pyramid
------------

The Test Pyramid is a concept in software testing that represents the ideal distribution of different types of tests in a software testing strategy. It was popularized by Mike Cohn in his book "Succeeding with Agile." The Test Pyramid is used to illustrate the recommended proportions of various levels of testing in an application, with the goal of achieving effective test coverage while keeping testing efforts manageable and efficient.

.. _trailing-comma:

Trailing Comma
--------------

The trailing comma is the possibility to leave the last element of a list empty. This is for presentation reasons. In particular, VCS will be able to treat the last line just like any aother previous line, with a final comma. This reduces de amount of diff.

Trailing commas were introduced progressively in PHP. In PHP 7.2, in use statements; in PHP 7.3, in method calls; in PHP 8.0, in method declarations; in very old version, in array declarations.


.. code-block:: php

.. _transpile:

Transpile
---------

Transpiling, short for "source-to-source compiling," is a process in software development where source code written in one programming language is transformed into equivalent code in another programming language. This is typically done to make code compatible with a different runtime environment, platform, or version of a language.

Transpilation is often used in the context of modern web development. For example, many developers write code using newer features of JavaScript, which may not be supported by older web browsers. In such cases, the code can be transpiled to an older version of JavaScript that is more widely supported.

.. _traversable:

Traversable
-----------

Traversable is a specific PHP interface that represents an object that can be iterated over.

Traversable is an abstract interface : it cannot be implemented directly, and instead, it must be implemented by either IteratorAggregate or Iterator. 

The traversable interface is used for typing purposes. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   try {
       doSomething();
   } catch (\Traversable $e) {

.. _traversal:

Traversal
---------

A traversal is the list of all elements in a data structure. 

foreach() is a command to do a traversal on an array or an iterable object. 

Traversal may be recursive : for example, the recursive iterators in the SPL library features the ``RecursiveArrayIterator`` class, which traverses multi-dimensional arrays.

Traversal of a tree or graph datastructure turns the graph into a array-like list.



.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
   
   $array = range(0, 9);
   
   foreach($array as $item) {
   	print "$item\n";
   	// list digits from 0 to 9
   }
   
   // adds 10, 11, 12 to the previous array
   // in a separate 
   $array[] = [10, 11, 12];
   
   $iterator = new RecursiveArrayIterator($array);

.. _typerror:

Type Error
----------

A ``TypeError`` is an error that occurs when there is a mismatch between the expected data type and the actual data type of a variable or value in your code. This applies to method arguments, property types and method return types. 

PHP is a dynamically typed language, which means that variable types are not explicitly declared, and PHP determines the data type at runtime. ``TypeError`` can occur when PHP encounters a situation where the expected data type does not match the actual data type.

``TypeError`` apply to typed custom methods, native PHP methods and operators. ``TypeError`` do not represent an invalid value: for example, an argument may be typed ``int``, and later used in a division, while being zero. This situation will yield a different exception.

``TypeError`` are a kind of ``Throwable``. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   function foo(User $user) {

.. _type-juggling:

Type Juggling
-------------

Type juggling is the emblematic PHP feature, where data has no specific type definition, and its type may change depending on the situation.

For example, integers are translated into string when displayed, or kept as integers to be used with math operations. 

Type juggling is usually done automatically, without user intervention. Explicit type juggling is achieved with the cast operators.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $a = "35";
   echo $a + 4; // display 39
   
   echo substr($a, -1); // display 5
   
   ?>

Type system
-----------

Type declarations can be added to function arguments, return values, and, as of PHP 7.4.0, class properties. They ensure that the value is of the specified type at call time, otherwise a TypeError is thrown. 

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   function foo(A $a) : void {}
   
   class x {
       private A $p;
   }

.. _typeerror:

TypeError
---------

A type error refers to an error that occurs when there is a mismatch or violation of data types. It typically happens when a function or operation is performed on a value of an incompatible type. PHP is a dynamically typed language, which means that variable types can change during runtime. However, certain operations and functions expect specific types, and if the actual type doesn't match the expected type, a type error may occur.

In other situations, PHP applies some type juggling, and automatically convert the type to a suitable type. This is often the case to preserve backward compatibility, when a transparent operation make sense. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   function foo(int $i) {  }
   
   try {
       foo('5');
   } catch (\TypeError $t) {
       print 'Wrong type of argument sent to foo()';
   }
   
   // PHP convert the integer 12 to the string '12', to allow the concatenation to proceed. 
   $number = 12;
   print "There are ".$number." apple in the tree.";

.. _unary:
.. _unary-operator:

Unary Operator
--------------

A unary operator is an operator that operates on a single operand. It performs an operation on the value of the operand. PHP supports several unary operators, including the following:

+ Post increment operator ``$a++``
+ Pre increment operator ``++$a``
+ Post decrement operator ``$a--``
+ Pre decrement operator ``--$a``
+ Negation operator ``-$a``
+ Logical Not operator ``!$a``
+ Bitwise Not operator ``~$a``

The four first operators change the underlying value and also return the value. The three last operators only return the changed value, leaving the original value unchanged.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $a = 10;
   print -$a;  // -10, $a unchanged
   print $a;   // 10
   print ++$a; // 10, $a changed
   print $a;   // 11
   
   ?>


Related : :ref:`Ternary Operator <ternary>`

.. _underflow:

Underflow
---------

Underflow happens when a value goes below a limit : out of its range of existence, the behavior of the value is now unknown.

Underflow happens with integers (limited to PHP_INT_MAX  and PHP_INT_MIN), floats (``PHP_FLOAT_MAX`` and ``PHP_FLOAT_MIN``). 

Other situations, such as accessing an array element or a string character beyond its first element, defaults to returning ``null``.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   $a = PHP_INT_MAX;
   $b = (int) ($a +  1);
   
   echo $a.PHP_EOL;
   echo $b;
   
   ?>


Related : :ref:`Null <null>`, :ref:`Overflow <overflow>`

.. _unexpectedvalueexception:

UnexpectedValueException
------------------------

The UnexpectedValueException exception is thrown if a value does not match with a set of expected values.

This happens when the value is not in a list of expected values, or if it is outside an interval of validity.

This exception is mainly thrown by the Phar and SPL extensions.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   function foo(string $s) {
       if (empty($s)) {
          throw new \UnexpectedValueException('Foo() expects a non-empty string');
       }
   }
   ?>

.. _unhandledmatcherror:

UnhandledMatchError
-------------------

An UnhandledMatchError is thrown when the subject passed to a match expression is not handled by any case of the match expression. This means that all the cases have been exhausted, and then, the ``default`` case is missing. 

Instead of finishing the ``match`` expression without any returned value, it throws an exception and stops the execution. This is a different behavior than ``switch``, which will continue the processing, even if nothing was found, potentially leading to unexpected situations.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $b = match(3) {
       1 => "A",
       2 => "b";
   };

.. _unicode:

Unicode
-------

Unicode is a standard to represent text. It is maintained by the Unicode Consortium. Unicode provides a widespread standard for characters. It is used everywhere, from computer to phones, online and offline.

Unicode motto : 'Everyone in the world should be able to use their own language on phones and computers.'

PHP supports unicode in its syntax with the declare() `encoding` option. 

PHP may translate from and to Unicode to other character sets with extensions such as iconv, intl, mbstring. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   $string = <<<XML

.. _union-type:

Union Type
----------

Union types refer to the ability to specify multiple possible types for a property, parameter, or return value. It allows a property or parameter to accept values of different types. It allows a method or function to return values of different types. Union types were introduced in PHP 8.

Before PHP 8, type declaration could only have a single type declaration, except for the null type. Nowadays, with union types, the code can declare multiple types by separating them with a pipe (|) symbol. 

Union types were introduced for exception catching, before PHP 8.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class x {
       private A | B | C $property;
   }
   
   try {
   
   } catch (A|B|C $e) {

.. _uri:

Universal Resource Identifier (URI)
-----------------------------------

Universal Resource Identifier is a unique sequence of characters that identifies a logical or physical resource used by web technologies.

URI are strings, with a special format, also called scheme, which allows identify uniquely a resource, without providing its location. 

For example, a ISBN is a unique universal identifier for a book, yet it doesn't mention where to find such book. 

URI is closely related to URL, which provides the location of the desired resource.



`Documentation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URI>`__

See also `List of URI schemes <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_URI_schemes>`_

Related : :ref:`Universal Resource Locator (URL) <url>`

.. _url:

Universal Resource Locator (URL)
--------------------------------

Universal Resource Locator is a string that represents a resource, where to find it, how to access it. 

The full URL include the following information : 

+ protocol : for example, http, https, mongodb, zip
+ user : the username for authentication purposes
+ pass : the password associated with the username
+ server : the name or the address of the server where the resource reside
+ path : the location of the resource on the server
+ query : extra parameters to reach the resource
+ fragment : the location of the resource inside the previous address (server + path)

PHP has several functions dedicated to processing URL, such as parse_url() and http_build_query(). 

PHP also makes use of URL as a generalisation for file path. For example, file_get_contents() and fopen() both work on local and remote files, via URL.

PHP is able to process different protocols with its internal Protocols and Wrappers, using the file system functions.



.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
   
   print_r(parse_url('https://www.php.net/'));
   
   /*
   Array
   (
       [scheme] => https
       [host] => www.php.net
       [path] => /
   )
   */
   
   // fetch the PHP home page
   $html = file_get_contents('https://www.php.net/'); 
   ?>

.. _unpacking:
.. _unpack:

Unpacking
---------

Unpacking has two meanings : 

+ unpack(), a PHP native function, which extracts data from a binary string. It has the pack() reverse function.
+ unpacking arguments, with the `...` operator : turning an array into a list of arguments.



Related : :ref:`Variadic <variadic>`

.. _unreachable-code:

Unreachable Code
----------------

Unreachable code refers to a section of code within a program that can never be executed during the program's runtime. It means that the code is written in such a way that it can never be reached or accessed by the program's execution flow.

Unreachable code can occur due to several reasons:

+ Conditional statements
+ Early return statements
+ Infinite loops
+ Branching with goto, yield, break, return, die...



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $a = 1;
   echo foo($a);
   
   exit; 
   
   // This is unreachable code, as it will never be executed
   echo $a; 
   
   // This is not unreachable, as PHP scoops the definition at linting time
   function foo($s) {
   	return strtolower($s);
   }
   
   ?>


.. _unserialization:
.. _unserialize:

Unserialization
---------------

Unserialization is the extraction of an object from a string representation of an object.

The reverse process is serialization. 

In PHP, there are different ways to implement serialization. The native way is to rely on the serialize() and unserialize(), which, in turn, rely on the __serialize() and __unserialize() magic method. Then, var_export() and require() make another serialization method. WDDX, XML, JSON or YAML all work as serialization, yet they usually are not considered, over speed or performance issues. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class X {
       private const X = 1;
       
       function foo() {
           // same as \X::C;
           return self::C;
       }
   }

.. _unset:

unset()
-------

unset() removes a variable. This feature used to be available as a function call `unset()` or as a type cast `(unset)`. The type-cast was removed in PHP 7.2.

   <?php
   
   $a = 1;
   unset($a);
   var_dump(isset($a)); // false
   
   ?>

.. _unused:

Unused
------

Unused is a state of a PHP structure. It has been declared, defined or created, but it is used. This is characteristics of dead code.

Being unused happens to constants, variables, parameters, properties, methods, classes, traits, interfaces, use expression. 

It also happens to propagate : removing an unused function may actually create another unused function, which was only called by the first one. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   const A = 1;
   const B = 2;
   
   echo A;
   
   // B is defined but not used
   
   ?>


.. _uopz:

UOPZ
----

The uopz - User Operations for Zend - extension exposes Zend Engine functionality normally used at compilation and execution time in order to allow modification of the internal structures that represent PHP code, and for user code to interact with the VM.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // Dynamically adds an interface to a class with UOPZ
   
   interface myInterface {}
   
   class myClass {}
   
   uopz_implement(myClass::class, myInterface::class);

.. _upgrade:

Upgrade
-------

An upgrade refers to the process of updating or replacing an existing installation of PHP or any library or component with a newer version. Major upgrade refers to a change in the first digit of the version, while minor upgrades are for the other numbers in the version.

An upgrade often require a migration: the current code has to be made compatible with the current version, but also with the upcoming version.

.. _use:

Use
---

The use operator has three distinct usage. 

The use operator allows the import and aliasing of fully qualified names (such as classes, interfaces, constants, ...)  in the current namespace. 

When `use` used inside a class or a trait, it imports a trait and its methods and properties. 

When `use` is used with a closure, it imports the listed variables in the closure, from the defining environment. 

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   namespace \My\Space {
       // class importation with use
       use \Some\Other\Space\aClass as A;
       
       class B {
           // trait importation of use
           use MyTrait; 
       
           function foo() {
               $a = 1;
               // use imports the variable $a in the closure. Its value is accessible at execution time.
               $closure = function ($b) use ($a) { return $a + $b;}
           }
       }
       // class importation with use
       use \Some\Other\Space\aClass as A;
       
   }

Use Alias
---------

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   use A as B;
   
   class A {}
   
   new A;

.. _userland:

Userland
--------

A `userland` feature, or definition, is a piece of code defined with PHP code, by one of the PHP developper. `userland` features are opposed to `native` features, which are available within PHP itself.

Functions, classes, enums, traits, constants, etc. may be userland. Loaded component with composer from packagist are also userland structures. 

The main difference between userland and native features are tenuous. Though, some very specific feature may be reserved to native features. For example, magic methods are case-insensitive (and magic), while userland constant cannot be case-insensitive. This is never critical.

There are some specific guidelines for userland naming. 


.. code-block:: php

   function foo() {}
   
   ?>

.. _uuid:

UUID
----

UUID is a Universally Unique IDentifier. It is an identifier that anyone can generate, and that has a near certainty that it identify something unique, in the universe. 

UUID are in contrast to classic integer ids, such as auto-increment primary keys, which usually start at 0, and are incrementally generated. Not only this means connecting to a database, and querying the right table, but also means that there are multiple usage of 1, in each of these tables.

UUID are a standard. The standard has versions from 1 to 5, each with improvements.

Validation
----------

Validation is the process to check that a data conform to a specific pattern or set of constraints. The data is not modified by a validation process. There are native and extension functions in PHP to perform validation, and components. 

Validation is also called filtering. 

.. code-block:: php

   if (intval($string) > 0) {
       print "The string is an integer";

.. _value-object:

Value Object
------------

A value object is a design pattern used to represent immutable objects that encapsulate a set of related values or attributes. Unlike entities, which are identified by their identity and can change over time, value objects are defined by their state and remain constant throughout their lifetime.

Value objects are typically used to model concepts that don't have a distinct identity but are important for the behavior and correctness of the system. For example, a Date value object can represent a specific date, and its attributes may include the year, month, and day. Another example is a Money value object that represents a monetary amount, including attributes such as the currency and the value.

.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
   
   class person {
   	public $name;
   	public $lastName;

   // Argument #2 ($from_base) must be between 2 and 36 (inclusive)
   echo base_convert($hexadecimal, 0, 2);
   
   // Third argument is for the starting offset. Here, this is beyond the end of the string

var_dump() displays the informations in a variable or any data container. It is a debugging function.

var_dump() is one of the most famous PHP function. It is often related to print_r(). 

Related : :ref:`print_r() <print_r>`

.. _variable-argument:

Variable Arguments
------------------

Variable arguments refers to a methodcall where the list of argument is depends on the call, rather than the signature of the method.

Variable arguments are achieved with the variadic operator, or with the func_get_args() functions. Variadic operator covers most of the cases, and func_get_args() covers the remaining edge cases. 

Variable arguments may be static or dynamic. It is static when the list of arguments varies from call to call, and are hard-coded. Dynamic argument list depends on variadic operator, or call_user_func_array() functions.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // No arguments in the signature.
   function foo() {
   	// displays the list of arguments
   	print_r(func_get_args());
   }
   
   // static arguments
   foo(1, 2);
   foo(4, 5, 6);
   
   // dynamic variable arguments
   $args = range(5, rand(9, 11)) ;

.. _variable-scope:

Variable Scope
--------------

Variable scope is the context in which the variable is available. The context is often one method or function. 

``global`` keywords allows variables from other contexts to be available in the current one. 

Local variables are only available in one method or function, not counting the local or bind closures or arrow functions. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   function foo() {
   	// $a is only available in foo
   	$a = 1;

Variable Variables
------------------

Variable variables refer to a feature that allows to use the value of a variable as the name of another variable. It provides a way to dynamically create and access variables based on runtime values.

Variable variables are denoted by the double dollar sign ``$$`` followed by the name of the variable stored in another variable. More dollar signs may be coumpounded, though it is rare.

The ``variable_order`` directive sets the order in which the values are assigned to the `$_REQUEST` variable.

The default is `EGPCS` : Environment, GET, POST, COOKIE and SESSION. The values are overwritten by the next, so if GET and POST have both an `x` variable, the default configuration will only keep the one from POST, as it is later in the configuration. 

The default configuration ensures that safer values, such as the session's value, are not overwritten by less safe values from GET or POST, for example.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // variable_order = EGPCS
   // https://www.example.com/index.php?x=1
   // POST x = 2;
   $_REQUEST['x'] === '2';
   
   ?>

.. _variable:

Variables
---------

Variables are used to store and manipulate data. They are containers that hold values, such as numbers, strings, arrays, objects, and more. Variables are an essential component of programming, allowing to store and retrieve information as needed throughout the code. 

Variables in PHP must start with a dollar sign ``$`` followed by the variable name. The name should begin with a letter or an underscore and can contain letters, numbers, and underscores. PHP variable names are case-sensitive.

PHP is a loosely typed language, which means you don't need to explicitly declare the type of a variable. PHP determines the variable's type based on the assigned value. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $a = 'a';
   // more calculations
   echo a;
   
   ?>

.. _variadic:
.. _splat:
.. _spread:

Variadic
--------

Three dots, aka ellipsis, is an operator to spread or collect array values. 

Applied to an array, it  spreads the values of the array as distinct elements.

Used in a function signature, it collects all the values into one array.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $array = [1, 2, 3];
   
   // same as foo(0, 1,2, 3);
   foo(0, ...$array, 4);
   
   
   function foo($special, ...$others) {
       // with the above call
       // $special === 0
       // $others === [1, 2, 3, 4]
   }

.. _vcs:
.. _scm:

VCS
---

VCS stands for Version Control System. It is a software tool or system that helps manage changes to files and documents over time. It is particularly useful in situations where multiple people are collaborating on the same project, allowing them to track modifications, work on different versions of files concurrently, and manage the history of changes. Version control systems are commonly used in software development, but they can also be applied to various other types of projects where tracking changes is important.

A VCS is also called a SCM : Source Control Management. 

VCS is a common tool to manage code versions. There are many such systems: GIT, mercurial, SVN, CVS, etc.

.. _version:

Version
-------

In the context of software development, a version refers to a specific iteration or release of a software product or application. It represents a distinct point in the evolution of the software, marking a milestone or set of changes made to the codebase.

Versions are typically assigned using a versioning scheme that helps track and identify different releases. Versions may be sequential, date based or semantic.

Versions serve several purposes : tracking changes, Compatibility management, Release management and Bug tracking and support.

.. _visibility:

Visibility
----------

Properties, methods and classes may have a visibility. It limits the scope of the definition :

+ private : to the current class
+ protected : to the current class hierarchy (parents and children classes)
+ public : to all the code

In PHP, the default visibility is public. 

Visibility may no change, unless when overwiting it with a trait, or in a child class.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class x {
       public const X = 1;

Void
----

Void is a return type. It marks methods which do not return anything. 

Indeed, void methods should not use the return statement, or, when they do, use it without any argument. 

Void is only possible with methods, closures, functions and arrow functions. It makes no sense with properties or parameters.

While
-----

While is a loop structure. It runs the block of code until the condition is not met anymore. 

The initialization, termination and increment expression may all host several instructions : they have to be separated by comma, rather than semi colons.

Part of the block execution may be skipped by using the `continue` keyword.

.. _xmlwriter:

XMLwriter
---------

The XMLWriter PHP extension is a built-in extension that provides a simple and efficient way to generate XML documents in PHP. It allows to create XML elements, attributes, text nodes, and other XML constructs using a procedural interface.

The XMLWriter extension offers several benefits when working with XML in PHP:

+ Efficient and low memory usage: The extension is designed to generate XML incrementally, allowing you to write large XML documents without consuming excessive memory.
+    Stream-oriented output: XMLWriter writes XML data to a stream, which can be a file, memory, or an HTTP connection. This enables you to generate XML directly without the need to store the entire document in memory.
+    Namespace support: XMLWriter supports XML namespaces, allowing you to define and assign namespaces to elements and attributes.
+    Character encoding and formatting: XMLWriter provides methods to set the character encoding of the XML document and control the formatting options, such as indentation and line breaks.
+    Validity and well-formedness checking: XMLWriter performs automatic validation and well-formedness checking as you write XML, ensuring that the generated XML document is compliant with XML standards.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // adapted from PHP Manual
   
   $xw = xmlwriter_open_memory();
   xmlwriter_set_indent($xw, 1);

.. _xxtea:

XXTEA
-----

XXTEA is a symmetric encryption algorithm that stands for 'Corrected Block TEA' (TEA refers to Tiny Encryption Algorithm). It is primarily used for encrypting and decrypting data, providing a level of security for sensitive information.

XXTEA operates on 32-bit integer data blocks and employs a 128-bit key. It uses a series of iterations and bitwise operations to scramble the data and make it unreadable without the corresponding decryption process. XXTEA is a block cipher with a fixed block size of 8 bytes.

.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
   $str = "Hello World! 你好，中国🇨🇳！";
   $key = "1234567890";

Yield
-----

In its simplest form, a yield statement looks much like a return statement, except that instead of stopping execution of the function and returning, yield instead provides a value to the code looping over the generator and pauses execution of the generator function.

yield from Keyword
------------------

The `yield from` keyword is used to delegate the iteration control of one generator to another. It was introduced in PHP 7.0 as part of the generator delegation feature. 

This keyword allows to create more maintainable and modular code by reusing the code logic of one generator within another.

Generator delegation works with another generators, Traversable objects, and arrays.

.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
   function inner() {
       yield 1; // key 0
       yield 2; // key 1
       yield 3; // key 2
   }
   function gen() {
       yield 0; // key 0
       yield from inner(); // keys 0-2
       yield 4; // key 1
