.. _$_files:

$_FILES
-------

An associative array of items uploaded to the current script via the HTTP POST method.

+ ``$_FILES['userfile']['name']`` : the original name of the file on the client machine.
+ ``$_FILES['userfile']['type']`` : the mime type of the file, if the browser provided this information. An example would be image/gif. This mime type is however not checked on the PHP side and therefore don't take its value for granted.
+ ``$_FILES['userfile']['size']`` : the size, in bytes, of the uploaded file.
+ ``$_FILES['userfile']['tmp_name']`` : the temporary filename of the file in which the uploaded file was stored on the server.
+ ``$_FILES['userfile']['error']`` : the error code associated with this file upload.
+ ``$_FILES['userfile']['full_path']`` : the full path as submitted by the browser. This value does not always contain a real directory structure, and cannot be trusted. Available as of PHP 8.1.0.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
       // $a->file was filled with $_FILES at some point
       move_uploaded_file($a->file['tmp_name'], $target);
   
   ?>

.. _$_get:

$_GET
-----

An associative array of variables, transmitted to the current script via the HTTP GET method, in the URL.

The received values are all strings or arrays. They are strings by default, and other scalar types needs a casting. The values are arrays when the URL uses the `[]` format. 

$_GET is a superglobal : it is always available, in every scope.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // https://www.example.com/index.php?x=1
   $_POST['x'] === '1';
   
   // https://www.example.com/index.php?y=abc
   $_POST['y'] === 'abc';
   
   // https://www.example.com/index.php?z[]=def&z[]=ghi
   $_POST['z'] === array('def', 'ghi');
   
   ?>

.. _$_post:

$_POST
------

An associative array of variables, transmitted to the current script via the HTTP POST method, with the MIME types `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` or `multipart/form-data`.

The received values are all strings or arrays. They are strings by default, and other scalar types needs a casting. The values are arrays when the URL uses the `[]` format. 

$_POST is a superglobal : it is always available, in every scope.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // POST x=1
   $_POST['x'] === '1';
   
   // POST y=abc
   $_POST['y'] === 'abc';
   
   // POST z[]=def
   // POST z[]=ghi
   $_POST['z'] === array('def', 'ghi');
   
   ?>

.. _$_request:

$_REQUEST
---------

An associative array of variables, transmitted to the current script via the HTTP GET and HTTP methods.

When the same name is used both in GET and POST method, the priority is defined by the `variable_order` directive. 

The received values are all strings or arrays. They are strings by default, and other scalar types needs a casting. The values are arrays when the URL uses the `[]` format. 

$_REQUEST is a superglobal : it is always available, in every scope.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // https://www.example.com/index.php?x=1
   $_REQUEST['x'] === '1';
   
   // POST y=abc
   $_REQUEST['y'] === 'abc';
   
   // https://www.example.com/index.php?z[]=def&z[]=ghi

.. _$http_raw_post_data:

$HTTP_RAW_POST_DATA
-------------------

$HTTP_RAW_POST_DATA contains the raw POST data. 

In general, ``php://input``` should be used instead of $HTTP_RAW_POST_DATA.  

This feature was removed in PHP 7.0.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
       // $a->file was filled with $_FILES at some point
       move_uploaded_file($a->file['tmp_name'], $target);
   
   ?>


`Documentation <https://www.php.net/manual/en/reserved.variables.files.php>`__

.. _$php_errormsg:

$php_errormsg
-------------

$php_errormsg contains the last error message, emitted by PHP. 

In general, error_get_last() should be used instead of $php_errormsg, although this function returns an array, not a string.

This feature was removed in PHP 8.0.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // Warning: Undefined variable $php_errormsg 
   // in PHP 8.0 (sic)
   echo $php_errormsg;
   
   print_r(error_get_last());
   
   ?>


`Documentation <https://www.php.net/manual/en/reserved.variables.phperrormsg.php>`__

Removed in PHP 

.. _$this:

$this
-----

$this is a variable

$this is also called a pseudo-variable. There is no special variable called `$that`.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // Warning: Undefined variable $php_errormsg 
   // in PHP 8.0 (sic)
   echo $php_errormsg;
   
   print_r(error_get_last());
   
   ?>

.. _-__clone:

__clone
-------

To clone an object is the creation of a new distinct object, from an existing one. This is basically a copy, although the object itself is multiplied by call the clone operator.

By default PHP does a shallow clone, duplicating the scalars (string, integer...) and keeping the same reference to objects. To make a deep clone, the class must define the ``__clone`` magic method.

Cloning is similar to creating another object of the same class, without requiring all the constructor arguments.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $spike = new Dog('Spike', 'Teckel', 'red');
   $medor = clone $spike;
   
   $medor->setCollar('green'); // distinguish spike and medor by collar
   
   ?>

.. _halt-compiler:

__halt_compiler()
-----------------

Halts the execution of the compiler. This can be useful to embed data in PHP scripts, like the installation files. 

Byte position of the data start can be determined by the ``__COMPILER_HALT_OFFSET__``` constant which is defined only if there is a __halt_compiler() presented in the file. 

Note : this is the documentation from PHP.net.



.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
   
   // adapted from the manual
   
   // open this file
   $fp = fopen(__FILE__, 'r');
   
   // seek file pointer to data
   fseek($fp, __COMPILER_HALT_OFFSET__);
   
   // and output it
   var_dump(stream_get_contents($fp));
   
   // the end of the script execution
   __halt_compiler(); This part of the file is read by the script.
   


`Documentation <https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.halt-compiler.php>`__

.. _-__invoke:

__invoke
--------

The __invoke() magic method is called when a script tries to call an object as a function.

.. _abstract:

Abstract Keyword
----------------

PHP has abstract classes and methods. Classes defined as abstract cannot be instantiated, and any class that contains at least one abstract method must also be abstract.

.. code-block:: php

   abstract class AbstractClass
   {
       // Force Extending class to define this method

.. _accessibility:
.. _a11y:

Accessibility
-------------

Accessibility is the process to make the code accessible to everyone. 

PHP code being text, its accessibility relies on the IDE. The main accessible feature is the usage of tabulations, instead of multiple spaces.

Accessibility is also called `a11y`, aka a, 11 letters and y. This is shorter to write. 


See also `Why we should default to Tabs instead of Spaces for an 'accessible first' environment <https://dev.to/alexandersandberg/why-we-should-default-to-tabs-instead-of-spaces-for-an-accessible-first-environment-101f>`_, `Tabs vs. Spaces: It's an Accessibility Issue <https://adamtuttle.codes/blog/2021/tabs-vs-spaces-its-an-accessibility-issue/>`_

.. _addition:

Addition
--------

PHP additions apply to two different types : numbers and arrays.

For numbers, aka integers or float, this is the classic mathematical addition. 

For arrays, this is a special version of array merge : the arrays are merged, and keys are kept once they are written. This features only exists for addition and arrays. Substraction is not available. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $a = 1 + 2.3; // 3.3
   
   $b = [1] + [3, 4]; // [1, 4]

.. _alternative-syntax:

Alternative Syntax
------------------

PHP offers an alternative syntax for some of its control structures; namely, if, while, for, foreach, and switch. In each case, the basic form of the alternate syntax is to change the opening brace to a colon (:) and the closing brace to endif;, endwhile;, endfor;, endforeach;, or endswitch;, respectively.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php if ($a == 5): ?>
   A is equal to 5
   <?php endif; ?>

.. _anonymous-class:

Anonymous Class
---------------

A class may be instantiated, without defining a class name. The class is identical to a named-class, except for the name attribute. This also means that it cannot be used for typehinting, though it may be typed itself, using parent class or implemented interfaces. 

Also, arguments may be passed at instantiation time, unlike with named-class definition, where those arguments are passed when calling ``new``, not when defining the class.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   	interface i {}
   	function foo(i $a) {}
   	
   	$a = new class () implements i {};
   	
   	foo($a);

.. _arbitrary-argument:

Arbitrary Number of Argument
----------------------------

PHP allows any number of arguments to be passed to a functioncall. In the function definition, receiving those arguments means managing an arbitrary number of parameters. 

This is achieved with the variadic operator, or with functions such as func_get_args().

They are also called variable argument lists.

When the arguments are dynamic, aka they are collected at execution time, the operator variadic or the function call_user_func_array() turns an array to arguments.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   function foo(...$args) {
       print This function is called with.count($args).arguments\n;
       print This function is called with.func_get_count().arguments\n;
       print This function is called with.count($func_get_args()).arguments\n;
   } 
   
   $array = range(0, rand(5, 10)); // generates an array with 1 to 11 elements
   
   foo(...$array);
   call_user_func_array('foo', $array));

ArgumentCountError
------------------

ArgumentCountError is thrown when too few arguments are passed to a user-defined function or method. This is an error, not an exception.

No exception is raised for extra parameters, as those may still be processed by the method itself. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   function foo($a) {}
   
   // No error is raised here
   foo(1,2);

.. _array:

Array
-----

array is the array structure in PHP. 

It may be written as array() or with square brackets `[]`.

An array assigns automatically an integer index to the values appended to it. An arbitrary index may be assigned with the => syntax, or when accessing an element in the array. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $array = array(1, 2, 3); 
   
   $anotherArray = ['a' => 2, 'b' => 33];

.. _append:
.. _array-append:
.. _push:

Array Append
------------

Append is an array operation, which adds an element at the end of the array. It is also called a push.

There are two operators for this feature ; the ``[]`` operator, which has to be placed after a variable or member. There is also the array_push() function, which is available as a callback, unlike the operator.

The opposite operation is a pop, with the function array_pop(). Array_unshift() is the append at the beginning of the array. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $array = [1, 2, 3];
   $array[] = 4;
   
   $array []= 5; // Same as above, with a notation similar to a short assignation
   
   array_push($array, 6);
   
   // $array === [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];

   <?php
   
   $a = [1,2,3];
   $b = [...$a, 4,5];

Assertions
----------

Assertions are checks that take effect in development and testing environments, but are optimised away to have zero cost in production. 

Assertions are disabled in production, by using the `zend.assertions` directive. Then, they are said 'zero-cost' : they are completely removed from the code, and not executed.

Assertions are a development tool, and should not be used. Be aware that the removal of the assertion may leave the system running with unchecked data. 

There are user-land assertions, such as `webmozart/assert <https://packagist.org/packages/webmozart/assert>`_ and `beberlei/assert <https://packagist.org/packages/beberlei/assert>`_.

Assignations
------------

The basic assignment operator is `=`. Your first inclination might be to think of this as `equal to`. Don't. It really means that the left operand gets set to the value of the expression on the right (that is, "gets set to").

Assumption
----------

An assumption is a piece of code that makes use of knowledge that is not visible in the script. 

Assumptions are often related to arrays : after checking that a variable is of type array, some specific index are used, while there is not garantee that they are available.

Assumptions may be upgraded to assertions. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
   
   function foo($o) {
   	if ($o instanceof A) {
   		print $o->getName();
   	} else {
   		// if $o is not an object of type A, then it is an array. Where does this come from?

.. _callback:

Callback
--------

Callback are functions which are used as parameters for other functions. Such functions are used to customize the main function. For example, array_map(), which applies a callback to every element of an array, or usort(), which sorts an array using a function.

Callback is akin to a functioncall : it is actually hidden inside the caller function. 

Callback may be build with on closures, arrow-functions, native PHP functions, methods and static methods. They also use string (i.e., `'strtolower'`) and array (i.e. `[X::class, 'methodName']`, or `[$object, 'methodName']` ) syntax. In fact, anything that is_callable() may be used. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $array = ['Damien', 'Dan', 'Daniel', 'Davey', 'David', 'Dennis', 'Derick', 'Dmitry', 'Dustin',];

.. _catch:

Catch
-----

Catch is the complement clause of try : it defines which exception is caught. Optionaly, it defines which variable holds the exception when it happens (since PHP 8.0).

Multiple catches may be used. They are applied in the order of coding, and the first clause which succeed is the last.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   try {
       callSomeMethod();
   } catch (\SomeException $e) {
       display(Warning);
   } catch (\SomeSeriousException $e) {
       display(Alert);
   } catch (\Exception) {
       // process the error here
   }

.. _class-alias:

Class aliases
-------------

It is possible to make an alias of a class and call it with this new name. It either rely on the `use` expression, preferable at the beginning of the namespace, or the class_alias() function, for dynamic and application-wide aliases. 

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   use a as b;
   
   class_alias('a', 'c');
   
   class a {
       function __construct() {
           print __CLASS__;
       }
   }
   
   new a;
   new b;
   new c;
   
   ?>

.. _autoload:

Class Autoloading
-----------------

Autoloading provides a hook to allow the loading of a class, the first PHP requires it. This is a more flexible way to handle the class definitions than the traditional inclusions, which requires good planning.

Autoloading requires each class, trait, interface or enumeration to be stored in a distinct file. This is the most popular way, yet autoloading allows any other strategy of storage, as long as the class may be loaded based only on its name.

Autoloading relies on the spl_autoload_register() function. Prior to PHP 8.0, it was possible to define the  __autoload() method, and this has being deprecated since PHP 7.2.

Autoloading does not work for global constants and functions. Those still require a specific inclusion mechanism.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   spl_autoload_register(function ($class_name) {
       include $class_name . '.php';
   });
   
   $obj  = new MyClass1();
   $obj2 = new MyClass2(); 
   ?>

.. _class-constant:

Class constant
--------------

It is possible to define constants on a per-class basis remaining the same and unchangeable. The default visibility of class constants is public.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class x {
       public  const FOO = 1;
       private const BAR = 2;

.. _class-operator:

Class Operator
--------------

Class operator is the `::class`, added to a class, interface, trait or enumeration identifier. It returns the fully qualified name of the class, according to the current code. 

`::class` is affected by `use` expressions, but not by class_alias(); function. 

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // class operator in action
   // This is an unknown class, so it displays A\B
   echo A\B::class;
   
   // This is an 'use' class, so it displays A\B
   use A\B as D;
   echo D::class;
   
   // class_alias creates a new class, so it is different. 
   class E{}
   class_alias('E', 'F');

.. _clone:

clone
-----

Clone makes a duplicate of an object.

PHP makes a shallow clone : it will only make a copy of the scalars properties, and it will keep the reference to any object untouched. This means that objects are shared between an object and its clone. 

To perform a deep clone, aka to clone an object and its referenced properties, there is the magic method __clone().



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class x { }
   
   // instantiation
   $x = new x;
   
   // cloning
   $y = clone $x;

Closure Binding
---------------

A closure acquires values from its context of creation. When the closure is created in a different context that wished, one may rebind the closure to another context.

This is done with the two methods Closure::bind() and Closure::bintTo();


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   class A {
       private static function foo() { return 1;}
   }
   
   $closure = function() {

.. _compact-array:

Compact array
-------------

An array is compact if it only uses automated indices, starting with 0. This doesn't really show in PHP code, though performances are better for some operations.

Such array's status may be reached by using array_values() or array_keys() on the array. 

This notion is not related to the compact() function.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $array = [1,2,3];
   
   $notCompact = [1,2,3, 4=>4];

.. _compact:

compact()
---------

compact() is a native PHP function, which creates an array containing variables and their values.

It is the opposite of extract().


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $a = '1';
   $b = '2';
   
   $array = compact('a', 'b');

.. _compression:

Compression
-----------

Compression is the representation of data in a format that uses less space that the original raw data. 

A compression algorithm must provide a way to compress data, and a way to uncompress it, and give access to the original data.

There are lossless compression, which can provide the exact original data (for text, ...) and lossy compression which degrades the original data (for images, video, ...).

PHP supports compression via zip, rar, zlib, bzip2.

Concatenation
-------------

Concatenation is the PHP feature that appends two strings together, to make a third, longer one.

Concatenation is also achieved with interpolation, inside a string; by calling echo, multiple times or with multiple arguments; by using the join() function.

Concatenation is done with the dot operator.

   <?php
   $a = world;
   $b = Hello;
   echo $b.$a;
   // displays Hello world

.. _conditioned:

Conditioned Structures
----------------------

Conditioned structures are definitions that are placed inside a condition structure. 

For example, it is possible to create a function or a class, only if it doesn't exist. 

classes, traits, interfaces, global constants (with define()), enumerations, functions may be conditioned. 

class constants, properties, methods and cases (for ``enum``) cannot be conditioned.

Conditioned structures adapt the PHP context to external condition. For example, some function may become native after a specific PHP version, and is only redefined for older installation. 

Some structures do not accept condition, such as global constants with `const` keyword (with define() function, it is OK).



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   if (!function_exists('foo')) {
       function foo() {

const is allowed inside classes and traits, to create class constants. const is also allowed in the global scope, to create global constants. 

const is only allowed in the body of a trait and a class, and the first level of a main file. It is not possible to create conditioned constants with a if-then structure and const : this requires an include.

---------

declare() construct is used to set execution directives for a block of code. 

declare() may set the following values : 

+ ``strict_types`` : strict typing in the block
+ ``ticks`` : generate a tick event 
+ ``encoding`` : per-file encoding directive


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php

.. _deep-clone:

Deep clone
----------

A deep clone is an object cloning, where the cloned object also clone its own object properties. This prevents the original object to share data with the cloned one, yet it is slower to process.

Deep cloning is achieved by using the ``__clone`` magic method. By default, PHP does shallow clone.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class Dog {
       private $name = '';
       private Address $address;
   
       function __construct(string $name, Address $address) {
           $this->address->setName($address);
       }
       
       function moves(string $address) {
           $this->address->setName($address);
       }
   
       function __clone() {
           $this->address = clone $this->address;
       }
   }
   
   $spike = new Dog('Spike', new Address('Acme city'));
   $medor = clone $spike;
   $medor->moves('Upstate farm');
   
   // spike and medor do now share the same address
   
   ?>

.. _default:

Default Keyword
---------------

default is a PHP keyword, used with switch() and match() structures. It represents any case that was not already considered.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   switch ($i) {
       case 0:
           echo i equals 0;
           break;
       case 1:
           echo i equals 1;
           break;
       default 2:
           echo i is not 0 nor 1;
           break;
   }
   
   ?>

Related : :ref:`switch <switch>`, :ref:`match <match>`, :ref:`case <case>`

.. _default-parameter:

Default Parameter
-----------------

Functions may define a default value for parameters. That way the parameter may be omitted during the call, and this value will be used. 

The default value may be a static expression, and, since PHP 8.1, also include new expression. 

The default parameter must be the last of the parameters : adding a parameter without default value after one will yield an error and mess up the call parameters.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   function makeCodffe($type = 'latte') {
       return Making a cup of $latte;
   }
   
   ?>

.. _default-value:

Default Value
-------------

Default value is the value that a variable or a property takes when it is used for the first time, and have not been provided.

Arguments and properties may have a default value. That way, arguments may be skipped when the method is being called, and the properties do not have to be initialized before usage.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   function foo($a = 1) {
       echo $a;
   }
   
   foo('one ');
   foo();
   
   // displays one 1
   
   ?>

.. _define:

define()
--------

define() is a PHP function, that introduces constant definitions. 

define() is a function, and may be called anywhere. It is slower than `const`, as it is only executed at runtime. define() doesn't allow class constants creation.

define() used to create case-insensitive constant, but this was abandoned in PHP 7.3.



.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
       define('HELLO', 'Hello');
       
       print HELLO . world\n;

.. _deprecated:

Deprecation
-----------

Deprecation is the state of a feature which is still available, but not recommended anymore. The next stage of life for the feature is the removal, usually in a major release.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   1 ? 2 : 3 ? 4 : 5;   // deprecated in PHP 7.4, removed in PHP 8.0
   (1 ? 2 : 3) ? 4 : 5; // ok
   
   ?>

.. _dereferencing:

Dereferencing
-------------

Dereferencing is the action to access a value, which is referenced with a pointer. Since PHP has no pointer per se, dereferencing applies to accessing an element in an array or an object. 

Dereferencing is also possible to function and methods calls : when a function returns an array or an object, it is possible to immediately access one of the element by using the array or method syntax.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $array = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
   
   echo $array['b'];
   
   function foo() {
       return ['x', 'y', 'z'];
   }
   
   foo()[2]; // display z
   
   ?>

.. _destructor:

Destructor
----------

The destructor is a special method in a class, which is called at shutdown of an object, in order to do any last minute cleaning. 

Most of the time, the destructor is automatic : removing scalar values may be sufficient. In cases of resources, or other objects, it is recommended to issue the graceful commands to shut them down in turn. 

Destructors are usually called after the end of the script, and will not have access to any display. As such, calls to echo are ineffective.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class X {
       private $file;
   
       function __construct($path) {
           $this->file = fopen($path, 'w');
       }
       
       function __destruct() {
           fwrite($this->file, End);
           fclose($this->file);
       }
   }

dirname
-------

Dirname is the name of the path to a file. 

In `/var/www/index.php`, the dirname is `/var/www`.

In PHP, dirname() provides the dirname from a path, based on the `/` separator. It has to be combined with basename() to get the name of the directory, without its path.

.. _do-while:

Do While
--------

Do While is a loop structure. It runs the block of code until the condition is not met anymore. The block is run once before the condition is checked, so it is always run at least once.

Part of the block execution may be skipped by using the `continue` keyword. 

 

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   /*
   do {
   	// the block

.. _dynamic-call:

Dynamic Call
------------

A dynamic call happens when part of the syntax comes from a variable, and is not known at code writing time.

In PHP, every syntax may use a dynamic call.

.. _dynamic-loading:

Dynamic Loading
---------------

Dynamic Loading is related to the loading of PHP extensions, at execution time. 

Most of the time, the extensions are compiled with PHP, and loaded at startup. For development purposes, or for distribution purposes, some libraries may be loaded at execution time, with the dl() function.

Dl() calls are considered bad for performances and for security. 



.. code-block:: php

Ellipsis
--------

Ellipsis operator is the `...` operator. It also bears the name of three dots, and even dot dot dot. 

It is used to implements the array spread feature, and the variadic arguments. The actual feature depends on the context. 

Ellipsis is the classic punctuation description of the operator, and will apply to both features.

Empty
-----

Empty is a language structure, which determines whether a variable is empty. 

A variable is considered empty if it does not exist or if its value equals false. This may overlap with the usage of isset().

Encoding
--------

Encoding is the way characters are organized to hold a meaning while being transmitted, stored or manipulated. 

Encoding applies to PHP scripts, which should be UTF-8 encoded, although it might support other formats.

Encoding applies to incoming and outgoing data.

Encoding operations are provided with mb_string, iconv and intl extensions. 


.. code-block:: php

Error Handler
-------------

The PHP error handler is a method that manages errors when they arise, instead of the default PHP handler. 

The error handler is set with the set_error_handler() function. 

The error handler is convenient to translate errors, handle custom levels of errors, or convert errors to exceptions. 

There is a separate exception handler. 

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   set_error_handler('customErrorHandler');
   
   function customErrorHandler($errno, $errstr, $errfile, $errline, array $errcontext)
   {
   	// Handles @ error suppression
   	if (error_reporting === 0)
   	{
   		return false;
   	}
   
   	throw new Exception($errstr, 0, $errno, $errfile, $errline);

.. _escape-character:

Escape Character
----------------

Escape characters are special characters, that introduce a special meaning, for example when redacting an escape sequence.

Escape characters are often generating a special sequence to escape themselves and allow their literal meaning to be expressed.

In PHP's strings and HEREDOC, the escape character is the backslash : \



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   echo <a href="https://www.exakat.io/" />
   
   ?>


`Documentation <https://www.php.net/manual/en/regexp.reference.escape.php>`__

See also `String literals (MySQL) <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/string-literals.html>`_

.. _escape-sequence:

Escape Sequences
----------------

Escape sequences are sequences of characters with a special meaning. Most of the time, the literal value of the character displayed is its meaning, while, sometimes, there are other hidden meaning.

An escape sequence is dedicated to a technology, and they are rare the same between two technologies, or even, between two engines dedicated to that technology.

Examples of escape sequences ; 

PHP, in strings: 
  + \n (new line)
  + \t (horizontal tabulation)
  + "  (double quote, inside a double quoted-string)
  + "  This is not an escape sequence : single quoted string do not recognize this

HTML : 
 + &acute; (a acute accent)
 + &quote; (double quote)

Escape sequences should not be confused with escape characters, though they are related : some escape sequences are introduced by an escape character. Others rely on a format. 
 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // \1 is an escape sequence that represents the first capturing parenthsis. 
   // It is a special meaning for REGEX.
   preg_match('/(.)\1/', $string);
   
   // Displays AA
   echo "A\101";

.. _extends:

extends
-------

`extends` is an operator of the class inheritence. It indicates that a class is built from another one, or an interface is built from another interface. As such, the properties, constants and methods of the parent class or interface are available to the newly created class, unless when they are marked with `private` visiblity. 

`extends` is optional. 

`extends` is unique with a class : it is not possible to extends several classes at the same time. 

`extends` may be multiple with interfaces.

`extends` has a different mechanism than `implements` : `implements` provide method signature but no implementation; `extends` provides both. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class x {
   	function foo() { echo X; }

.. _extract:

extract()
---------

extract() is a native PHP function, which creates arrays from an array containing variables and their values.

extract() has option to handle situations where the variables are already existing, and how those conflicts should be handled : by default, it overwrites the local variables.

Options are :  ``EXTR_OVERWRITE``, ``EXTR_SKIP``, ``EXTR_PREFIX_SAME``, ``EXTR_PREFIX_ALL``, ``EXTR_PREFIX_INVALID``, ``EXTR_IF_EXISTS``, ``EXTR_PREFIX_IF_EXISTS``, ``EXTR_REFS``.

It is the opposite of compact().

File Upload
-----------

PHP is able to receive files as part of a form submission. 

PHP is capable of receiving file uploads from any RFC-1867 compliant browser. 

File upload code is based on the $_FILES superglobale, and move_uploaded_file() function. It also relies on several PHP directives :  ``file_uploads``, ``upload_max_filesize``, ``upload_tmp_dir``, ``post_max_size`` and ``max_input_time``. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   $uploaddir = '/var/www/uploads/';

.. _for:

For
---

For is a loop structure. It is configured with an initialization expression, a terminaison expression and an increment expression. 

The for() loop executes the init expression first, and only once. Then it executes the block, the increment and the terminaison. When the terminaison is false, it exits the loop.

The initialization, terminaison and increment expression may all host several instructions : they have to be separated by comma, rather than semi colons.

Part of the block execution may be skipped by using the `continue` keyword.

.. _foreach:

Foreach
-------

Foreach is the most popular loop in PHP. 

The foreach() loop uses all the elements of the source, and assign them to the blind variable. By default, only the value is assigned; when using the `$key => $value` syntax, the key is also assigned. Then the block is executed with the assigned values. 

Part of the block execution may be skipped by using the `continue` keyword. 

The value may be a reference : then it actually references the original value, which then may be modified in the source. Do not forget to unset referenced variables after the loop, to avoid the dangling reference syndrom, when the last value is changed.

The value may be an array, collecting several values at the same time.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   /*
   foreach($source as $key => $value) {
   	// block

Frameworks
----------

A framework is a library that helps building PHP applications, mostly web, but also CLI. frameworks provide commonly features, such as forms, authentications, templating, arguments and security. 

Frameworks are often described as a platform : they stand as a layer above PHP, with its own conventions and behaviors. PHP is the language of the framework, and the language used to extends the framework.

There are lots of frameworks in PHP. In alphabetical order, here are some :

.. _garbage-collection:
.. _gc:

Garbage Collection
------------------

Garbage collection is a PHP mechanism that checks memory and frees it when it needs to store new values. 

PHP allocate memory as it needs, when variables and objects are created in the code. Sometimes, those variables are destroyed, using explicit unset() calls, or implicitely, when leaving a method or destroying an object. 

To speed up the process, PHP postpone memory cleaning until the end of the application, or when it reaches some internal threshold. Then, it review all the currently allocated variables, and when they are not used anymore (aka, when the reference counter is down to 0), it removes them.

Since garbage collection requires pausing the execution, PHP only runs it on-demand (via gc_collect_cycles() calls), or once every 10k objects to clear.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // Explicit Garbage Collection 
   gc_collect_cycles();
   
   // implicit garbage collection
   // well,... difficult to illustrate, right?
   
   ?>

Generator
---------

Generators provide an easy way to implement simple iterators without the overhead or complexity of implementing a class that implements the Iterator interface.

Generator must have no return typehint, or use the \Generator typehint.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   function evenIntegers() {
       for ($i = 0; $i < 10; ++$i) {
           yield 2 * $i;

.. _global-variable:

Global Variables
----------------

Variables that reside in the global scope, and may be imported with the global keyword.

To become a global variable, a variable may use one of the following ways : 

+ Be declared as such with the `global` keyword
+ Be created in the `$GLOBALS` variable, which is a global variable itself
+ Be created 

 

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   
   global $count;
   $count = 0;

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   global $x;
   $x = 'A';
   
   function counter() {

.. _hard-coded:

Hard Coded
----------

Hard coded data in code happens when a value is set as a literal in the code, and can't be change through any directives or parameters.

Hard-code becomes a security problem, when the hard-coded value is a password or a hash of it. This secret is now readable in the code.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php 
   
   // This is hard-coded
   $a = 1;
   
   // $b has a default value, but may also be changed at execution time
   function foo($b = 2) {
       echo $b;
   }
   
    ?>
   


`Documentation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_coding>`__

.. _hash:

Hash
----

Hash is both a PHP extension, a PHP function and a general computer science concept. Hash allows direct or incremental processing of arbitrary length messages using a variety of hashing algorithms. 

While the extension 'hash' only process hashes, there are other extensions which offer these features : openssl, sodium and password hashing. Mhash and mcrypt are older PHP extensions, which are now discontinued. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
   
   echo hash('ripemd160', 'The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.');
   // produces ec457d0a974c48d5685a7efa03d137dc8bbde7e3

Added in PHP 4.0+

.. _heredoc:

Heredocs
--------

Heredoc is a string syntax, similar to nowdoc, with internal variable interpolation. They behave like double quoted strings.

The Heredocs syntax uses an arbitrary delimiter. The same delimiter will mark the end of the string.

Heredocs are convenient for large amount of text, that has to be hardcoded. Smaller string will be better suited with double quotes, while even longer text should be processed with a templating system.

It is possible to indent the text in a nowdocs string: to avoid this indentation to be passed at execution time, the final delimiter may be indented too. Its indentation will be removed from the parsed text.

 

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $heredoc = <<<DELIM
   This is a long text.
   
   $variable will not be replaced, and the text stays intact.
   
   DELIM;
   
   $heredoc = <<<DELIM
       This is an indented text.
       DELIM;
   
   ?>

.. _hexadecimal-integer:
.. _hexadecimal:

Hexadecimal Integer
-------------------

Hexadecimal integers are integers with an hexadecimal representation. Their value is the same, yet their are written in a different way than the common decimal. 

Hexadecimal has native support in PHP with the ``0x123`` format. There is also support for hexadecimal characters, inside double-quote strings, with the ``\xhh`` syntax.

There are functions to convert from and to hexadecimal format : hexdec(), dechex() and base_convert(), from ten to sixteen.

PHP also has special syntax for binary and octal numbers. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
       $twenty    = 0x14;
       $twentyToo = 20;
       
       $i = \x69; // i is the 105 ASCII code
       $i = 'i';

.. _http-header:

HTTP headers
------------

HTTP headers are extra information, exchanged between the server and the client, to configure further the network transaction. 

They are separated from the content, which usually represents the HTML page, or the binary  code of the image, archive. 

HTTP headers have a name, and a value. They are made of ASCII text, and separated by a colon `:`

HTTP headers are the same with HTTPS.

In PHP, they are handled by the functions prefixed by `header_` : headers_sent(), headers_list(), header(), header_remove(), header_register_callback()


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   function foo($a, $b) {
       return $a - $b;

.. _if-then:

If Then Else
------------

A if-then-else command branches the execution based on an condition. When the condition is true, the first branche, called `then` is executed. When the condition is false, the second branch, called `else`, is executed. 

If-then structures may be chained with the `elseif` keyword. The else branch is then a new if-then structure, with a second condition. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $number = rand(0, 10);
   
   if ($number % 2 === 0) {

.. _iffectation:

Iffectation
-----------

An iffection is both an assignation and a condition at the same time. 

Assignation is a condition is debated. It makes the code less readable, as the assignation is hidden in the if condition.

It also saves some extra lines of code, when the condition applies to something that will immediately be used. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   if ($x = foo()) { }
   
   // same, without the iffectation
   $x = foo();
   if ($x) { }
   
   
   ?>


.. _imagickexception:

ImagickException
----------------

The ImagickException exception is thrown when an error happens while processing an Imagick operation.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   try {
       $imagick->gammaImage($correction, \Imagick::CHANNEL_ALL);
   } catch (\ImagickException $e) {

.. _immutable:

Immutable
---------

An immutable object is an object that can't be changed. It may be created, read and cloned. On the other hand, a mutable object may change when one of its method is called, even if this is not visible from the outside.

Immutable objects are thread-safe. 

Immutable objects often return a clone version of themself after a modification. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
   
   class x {
   	private $x = 0;
   	
   	function inc() : self {
   		$return = clone $this;
   		$return->x +=1;
   		
   		return $return;
   	}
   }
   
   $a = new x();
   $b = $a->inc();

.. _include:

Inclusion
---------

Inclusion is the process to read an external file, and evaluate with the current application for execution. It may define new structures, and execute code. 

Inclusion relies on four language structures : include, require, include_once, require_once. 

Inclusion is often hidden in autoload() functions : the code is included class per class, upon request. 



.. code-block:: php
   
    vars.php
   <?php
   
   $color = 'green';
   $fruit = 'apple';

.. _incoming-data:

Incoming Data
-------------

Incoming data are data submitted to PHP by the user. They may come in different way : GET, POST, cookies or files; and, by extension, $_REQUEST. 

Incoming data should always be checked before usage. Their value may have been modified by the author of the source, and carry some malicious payload.

The encoding of the incoming data are controled with the `default_charset` directive.

By extension, incoming data may be used to every source of data that is not PHP itself : files, databases, API, etc. Then, they should be treated the same way, with checks on format and value before usage. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
   
   if ($_GET['x'] === '1') {

.. _index:

Index
-----

A index is the identifier of an specific element in an array. They may automatically generated, by simply omitting them at creation time. 

PHP index may be integers or strings only. Other data types generate an error or a type conversion. For example, floats are turned into integer. integer-shaped strings will also be turned into integer.

PHP index start at 0. They may be automatically assigned by appending a new value with the `[]` operator : then, they use the greatest available index + 1.


.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
       $array = ['a', 'b', 'c'];

.. _inequality:

Inequality
----------

Inequalities are the mathematical comparison of values, with the `>`,  `>=`,  `<` and `=<` operators. 

Unlike the equality operators, they do not have a strict version, which takes into account the type of the values. Hence, the compared values are always adapted to each other's type.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // displays false
   var_dump(3 > 3);

Injection
---------

Injection is the usage of a resource (data, object, services...) that is provided to the method, by the caller.

There are good injections, as the dependency injection.

There are bad injections : all the security ones. SQL injection, PHP code injection, CSV injection, XML injection, etc. Those attempt to change reroute the execution of the method to gain access to unprotected resources.

`instanceof` has a higher precedence than `!` operator, so it is applied before the latter.  In case of confusion, use parenthesis.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   if ($user instanceof Administrator) {
       $user->admin();
   }
   
   // If The user is not of class User...
   if ( !$user instanceof User ) {
   //if ( !($user instanceof User) ) {
       $user->admin();
   }
   
   ?>

integer
-------

An int is a number of the set ℤ = {..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...}. It is limited by PHP_INT_MIN (lower bound) and PHP_INT_MAX (upper bound). 

Integers have several syntaxes : they may be written in binary, octal, decimal, hexadecimal and with `_` as a separator. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $a = 1234;       // decimal number

.. _i18n:
.. _localization:

Internationalization
--------------------

Internationalization is the process to make the human interface of a program in a local language. 

PHP includes some internationalization capabilities, via the locale, for dates or money format, or with the ext/intl extension. 

Most of the interface translations for application is done with specific components, such as `Symfony/translation`. Translation of interface messages is part of this concept.

Internationalization is also called `i18n`, aka i, 18 letters and n. This is shorter to write. This word may be written with a z or an s, depending on the flavor of English being used.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   /* Configure le script en hollandais */
   setlocale(LC_ALL, 'nl_NL');
   
   /* Affiche : vrijdag 22 december 1978 */

The internationalization extension performs operations with locales. For example, it formats dates according to country and language configurations. The operations include, and are not limited to, formatting, transliteration, encoding conversion, calendar operations, » UCA-conformant collation, locating text boundaries and working with locale identifiers, timezones and graphemes.

This extension is closely linked to the ICU library.

Language construct
------------------

PHP has 'language construct', which are special keywords, with an attached feature. 

Language constructs are : echo, require, require_once, include, include_once, return, die, exit, unset, isset, print, empty.

Language constructs usually do not require parenthesis, and they are mostly known for that. The parenthesis is not necessary, but possible. It makes the language construct look like a function call. 

Also, language construct do not behave like a function, so they can't be used by their name, as a callback. 

There have some special behavior : echo accepts an arbitrary number of argument, while print only accepts one. die and exit work without arguments, but, in the event that an argument is provided, it must be enclosed in parenthesis.

.. _linting:
.. _lint:

Linting
-------

Linting is the process to turn the Text file that holds the source code, into tokens. During this first phase, PHP applies some checks, and report anything that makes no sense.

After linting, the code is processed further before reaching the status of opcode, where it can be executed. 

Linting is an option of the PHP CLI : `-l`. 

Linting is sometimes mistaken with 'compiling' : linting is a part of a compilation. Since, it is the only step available in PHP between the code and the execution (with eval() or the PHP CLI), linting is often considered as compiling.

.. _list:

list
----

List() acts as the contrary to array() : it will break an array into individual elements, and assign them to the arguments of the list. 

List() also has a short array version, which is `[ ]` the square brackets. Those square brackets are only appearing on the left side of an assignation. 

list() may omit extracted values by skipping their value, and leaving seemingly empty arguments. List() also supports double-arrow notation, where the key is provided. 

list() may be nested. It may also be used with foreach() structures.

list() looks like a function, though it only appears on the left part of an assignation, and is actually a language-construct.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   list($a, $b, $c) = [1,2,3];
   
   [$a, , [$c]] = [1,2,[3],4];

Locale are a set of configuration which describe how to handle different formats of data, such as monetary values, dates and time.

Locales are extracted from the system, and depends on a country name and a language name. For example, `fr-FR` for French French, `nl_NL` for Dutch, or `zh_CN` for Chinese Chinese. 

Locale are supported with the ext/icu extension, and also, natively with the setlocale() function.

Logical operators applies four logical functions to booleans. 

+ ``and`` and ``&&``
+ ``or`` and ``||``
+ ``xor`` (no symbolic version for ``xor``)
+ ``!``  (no letter version for ``not``)

The logical operators are either symbolic or letter. Be aware that the symbolic operators have a higher precedence than the letter one, in particular vis-à-vis comparisons.

The logical operators work on various types, and output booleans. They are different from the bitwise operators, which work on the value as a bit level, not as a whole.

Magic Constants
---------------

Constants which hold information about the current location of the code.

Those constants are magic, because they have a constant syntax, yet their value may change, even during the execution of the code. 

+ __LINE__	The current line number of the file.
+ __FILE__	The full path and filename of the file with symlinks resolved. If used inside an include, the name of the included file is returned.
+ __DIR__	The directory of the file. If used inside an include, the directory of the included file is returned. This is equivalent to dirname(__FILE__). This directory name does not have a trailing slash unless it is the root directory.
+ __FUNCTION__	The function name, or {closure} for anonymous functions.
+ __CLASS__	The class name. The class name includes the namespace it was declared in (e.g. Foo\Bar). When used in a trait method, __CLASS__ is the name of the class the trait is used in.
+ __TRAIT__	The trait name. The trait name includes the namespace it was declared in (e.g. Foo\Bar).
+ __METHOD__	The class method name.
+ __NAMESPACE__ The name of the current namespace.

Those constants are case insensitive. All those syntax will work : `__METHOD__`, `__method__`, `__method__`.

Memoization
-----------

Memoization is an optimisation technique to speed up a function by avoiding re-processing previously calculated results.

.. _named-constructor:

Named Constructors
------------------

Named constructor is a class organisation, where several static factories are created to instantiate the object, based on arguments. They usually prepare the argument, to call the constructor the right way. 

That approaches makes the construction of the object simpler, and reduces the number of conditionals. 

As Matthias Verraes puts it : 'Don't limit yourself by PHP's single constructor. Use static factory methods.'

.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
   
   // parse a single string
   $user = Person::createFromTitle('Mr John Smith');
   
   $user = Person::createFromNames('John', 'Smith');
   
   class Person {
   	// constructor is private, $parameters are not documented
   	private function __constructor( ) {}
   	
   	static public function createFromNames(string $firstName, string $lastName) : self {
   		// assign the argument to the right parameter of the constructor
   	}
   
   	static public function createFromTitle(string $fullName) : self {
   		// parse the string, and calls the constructor
   	}

A feature is called 'native' when it is part of the standard installation of PHP. For example, `.` (dot operator) or the `stdClass` class are native to PHP.

A feature may also be custom, when defined by the developer or extension, when defined in a PHP extension.

.. _new:
.. _instantiation:

new
---

new creates a new object from a class. This operation is called the instantiation. 

The class must be available at instantiation call : PHP will search for it in the declared classes, then call the autoloader to find it. In case no class is found, and error is emitted.

The instantiation calls immediately the constructor of the object : it is the method called ``__construct``. 

The constructor defines how many arguments are needed. When no argument is needed, new may also be called without parenthesis.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class x {
       function __construct($a = 1) {}
    }
   
   // instantiation

.. _non-breakable-space:

Non breakable spaces
--------------------

Space is one of the base ascii character. They are often used to separate words, and are forbidden from being used in names. 

PHP supports Unicode characters, and some of the characters are called : non breaking spaces. They behave like a space, by displaying a blank area. Yet, they are recognized internally as a non-space, and can be used in a name.

Non-breakable spaces are useful for tests, as they make the testing name more readable. They are also quite rare, and confusing for newcomers.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // This is a space, it won't compile
   const A B = 1;
   
   // This is a non breakabe space, it compile and is not visibly different from the line above
   const A B = 1;
   
   ?>

.. _nowdoc:

Nowdocs
-------

Nowdocs is a string syntax, similar to heredoc, and without internal parsing. They are similar to single quoted strings, compared to double quoted ones.

The Nowdocs syntax uses an arbitrary delimiter, which has to be enclosed in single quotes. The same delimiter will mark the end of the string.

Nowdocs are convenient for large amount of text, that has to be hardcoded. Smaller string will be better suited with single-quotes, while even longer text should be stored in an external storage, such as a file.

It is possible to indent the text in a nowdocs string: to avoid this indentation to be passed at execution time, the final delimiter may be indented too. Its indentation will be removed from the parsed text.
 

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $nowdoc = <<<'DELIM'
   This is a long text.
   
   $variable will not be replaced, and the text stays intact.
   
   DELIM;
   
   $nowdoc = <<<'DELIM'
           This still will start at the first word, not at the beginning of the string.

.. _operator-precedence:

Operator Precedence
-------------------

The operator precedence dictates in which order the operators in a same sequence are executed. 

For example, in the code `1 + 2 * 3`, the order is the mathematical order : multiplication has precedence over addition. The results is 7, not 9. 

In PHP, operators have different predecence : `.` (dot) has a lower priority than addition `+` and `-`.  

Precedence may lead to unexpected behavior. For example, `-9 ** 2 == -9`, because `-` has lower precedence of **. and PHP doesn't parse negative numbers in one pass. 

Also, `$a = $b & $c;` means that `$a = $b;`, because `=` has a higher priority than `&`.



.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
   
   // 7, not 9
   $a = 1 + 2 * 3; 
   
   // 11
   $a = 4 * 2 + 3; 
   
   // equivalent to !($a instanceof aClass)
   // ! has lower precedence than instanceof

Outgoing Data
-------------

Outgoing data are data submitted by PHP to an external user. The default may be the user's browser, and the usual formats may be HTML, or JSON. Yet, there are many other destinations, such as databases, files, API, other process and formats, such as CSV, text, PDF, etc.  

Outgoing data should always be formatted with the target technology. For example, text should use HTML entities for HTML output, or be provided as prepared statement with a database. Each target has its own system of protection.

The encoding of the incoming data are controled with the `default_charset` directive.

Other situations, such as accessing an array element or a string character beyond its last element, defaults to returning `null`.

.. _overloading:

Overwrite
---------

Overwriting is the process to replace a method, property or constant that was defined in a parent, by a local definition. This is related to OOP programming and inheritance.

Overwriting is applicable to constants, methods and properties. Methods still should have a compatible signature with their parent's equivalent, while properties and constants may change their (default) value.

Overwriting is prevented by the ``final`` keyword, or the ``private`` visibility.

Overwriting is also called overloading.

       const Y = 1;
       const Z = 2;

   class xx extends x {
       // Z is inherited, and its value is 2    
       // Y used to be 1, it is now 31
       const Y = 31;

.. _parameter:

Parameter
---------

A parameter is a variable in a method definition. They have a name, and may have a default value and typehint. They may also be passed by reference, or by value (by default).

.. _parent:

parent
------

parent is one of the three special keywords that are used to access properties or methods from inside the class definition. It relates to the first parent class, or any or their own parents. In particular, when searching for methods or properties, it may skip the direct parent, and land on one of the parent above.

Parent represents the first parent of the class. 

In a trait, parent represents the host class's parent, not the trait own parent. In fact, the trait has no parent.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class W {
       protected const X = 1;
   }
   
   class X extends W {
       function foo() {
           // could also be written as \W::C; here

.. _by-reference:

Passing By Reference
--------------------

When calling a method, or returning from it, data may be passed by value or by reference. 

By reference, a reference to the the data is passed : any modification on that value inside the method will be reflected in the original value. 

This is the alternative way of passing data to methods : the default way is to use by value, which copies the data. 

Passing by reference is the default behavior with object. Otherwise, it needs to be declared with the ``&`` operator, in the function signature.

Returned value are passed back to the calling context with the same rule than for parameters.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $a = 0;
   foo($a);  // displays 1
   print $a; // displays 1
   
   function foo(&$a) {
       ++$a;
       echo $a;
   }

.. _by-value:

Passing By Value
----------------

When calling a method, or returning from it, data may be passed by value or by reference. 

By value, a copy of the data is passed : any modification on that value inside the method will not be reflected in the original value. 

This is the default way of passing data to methods : the alternative way is to use by reference. 

Passing by value may be memory-intensive when passing a large array. This is not the case for objects, which are always passed by reference.

Returned value are passed back to the calling context with the same rule than for parameters.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $a = 0;
   foo($a);  // displays 1
   print $a; // displays 0

.. _persistence:

Persistence
-----------

Persistence is related to the life cycle of a resource. A piece of data is said to be persistent when it exceeds the duration of the current process.

In particular, databases, sessions, shared memory, file system or cache allows for persistent storage : the current process may store data there, and retrieve it later, provided it has transmitted an identifier. 

Persistence also applies to database connexion, where the connexion is not closed at the end of the current process, but stays open for the next to reuse it, saving some overhead, but keeping a connexion open even if not busy.

Persistent storage may also be called permanant storage.

.. _pdo:

PHP Data Objects (PDO) 
-----------------------

PHP Data Objects (PDO) is an interface that abstract access to databases. The same interface may be used to access different databases. 

PDO may access 10 different databases : 
+ CUBRID
+ MS SQL Server
+ Firebird
+ IBM
+ Informix
+ MySQL
+ MS SQL Server
+ Oracle
+ ODBC and DB2
+ PostgreSQL
+ SQLite 2 and 3

The different access relies on drivers and DSN to connect to a database. The DSN describes the server to reach, and the driver handles the communication protocol.

.. _php-tag:

PHP tags
--------

When PHP parses a file, it looks for opening and closing tags, which are <?php and ?> which tell PHP to start and stop interpreting the code between them. 

The classic PHP tag is `<?php`, and it also has a short version, for better serving xml tags : `<?`. This one relies on the `short_open_tag` directive.

Previously, PHP supported also Javascript-style and ASP-style tags, though these are now unsupported.


.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
     // This is the classic PHP tag
   
   ?>

.. _plus:

plus +
------

`+` is a native PHP operator, which has three usage : 

+ The addition, as in mathematics. This works on integers and double.
+ The merging of arrays. This merge sets the keys once, then omits the next values.
+ The + sign in front of a number, to make it explicitely positive. This is optional, and may be repeated.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $a = 1 + 2; // 3
   
   $b = [1, 2] + [3, 4, 5]; // [1,2, 5]

.. _precedence:

Precedence
----------

Precedence organizes the way operators are executed, when they are mixed in the same expression.

For example, `1 + 2 * 3` will produce `7`, since `*` has a higher precedence than `+`. 

Every operator has a precedence, and when they have the same precedence, the rightmost one yield to the leftmost one.

Precedence offers some reading surprises to human readers. For example, `! $b instanceof \X` really applies `instanceof` first, and `&&` has a higher priority than `and`, even though they perform the same function.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   var_dump(!$b instanceof \X);
   var_dump($a = 1 and 2);

.. _predefined-constant:

Predefined Constants
--------------------

Predefined constants are PHP native constants, available at the start of the PHP engine. 

Those constants are for internal usage, such as E_ALL, for error reporting, or STDOUT, for output. Some constants are providing information, such as PHP_VERSION's PHP version number. Others are meant to give a readable name to common values or arguments, such as DATE_RFC822. 

Other constants come from extensions : for example, the Math extension defines M_PI for the pi constant (3.14159...), libsodium defines SODIUM_CRYPTO_CORE_RISTRETTO255_SCALARBYTES, etc. Those are also predefined constants, although they depend on the compilation of PHP.


.. code-block:: php

.. _preprocess:

Preprocess
----------

Preprocessing is an optimisation technique, where a value is calculated even before the execution of a script. This is only possible with constants values, which are known before execution.

Preprocessing may save execution time, and memory. 

In terms of maintenance, it hides some implementation details in the result : one has to guess where this value is coming from.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $seconds = 60;
   $minutes = 60;
   
   $hours = $seconds * $minutes;

private Keyword
---------------

The private keyword is part of the three keywords to define visibility of a method, property or constant. It is the strictest level of visibility : it restrict usage to the current class only. Child class can't redefine it, nor access it.

The private keyword cannot be used with the final keyword : a private method is not visible in the child classes, and can't also be redefined.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class x {
       private const X = 1;

They might be readonly, for properties which are only set once, and cannot be modified. 

They might be static, and not related to an object, but to a class. 

Property should be uniquely defined in a class. They may be redefined in children or parent when the visibility allows it.

Readability
-----------

A code is readable, or easy to read, if all the needed information is available in the code, without the need to reach for an extra piece of reference to understand it.

Readable code may be understood on the spot, while unreadable code hides some important part of the process. 

Readability is a human characteristic of the code : it depends on the level of knowledge of the reader. Good naming is an important part of readability, as intention are conveyed.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // all explicit alphabet
   $alphabet = array ( 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z');
   
   // readable with knowledge of range() function

   // generic name for a partial list of letter : many questions hang
   $array = range('a', 'l');
   
   ?>


.. _readonly:

Readonly
--------

A property can be declared with the readonly modifier, which prevents modification of the property after initialization.

Readonly also applies inside the __clone() magic method : cloning doesn't allow for changing a readonly property.

In PHP 8.2, a class may be readonly, making all of of its properties readonly too.

Recursion in PHP is a method or a function, which calls itself. 

While the method calls itself, it also must have branch and not call itself : otherwise, the call will never end.

Functions, methods, closures and arrowfunctions may be recursive.

Recursion is an abstract notion : it is also used in the PHP name itself. PHP : Hyperthext Preprocessor.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   function factorial(int $number) { 
       if ($number < 2) { 
           return 1; 
       }
   
       return ($number * factorial($number - 1)); 
   }
   
   // recursive closure
   $factorial = function( $n ) use ( &$factorial ) {
       if( $n == 1 ) return 1;
       return $factorial( $n - 1 ) * $n;
   };
   
   ?>

.. _reference:

References
----------

References in PHP are a means to access the same variable content by different names. 

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $a = 1;
   
   $b = &$a; 
   $b = 2;
   
   echo $a;
   // displays 2
   ?>

.. _reflectionexception:

ReflectionException
-------------------

ReflectionException is thrown whenever the Reflection API encounters an error.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
       try
       {
           $ref = new ReflectionClass($class);
       }
       catch (ReflectionException $e)
       {
           var_dump($e->getMessage());
       }
   
   ?>


`Documentation <https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.reflectionexception.php>`__

.. _register-globals:

Register Globals
----------------

Register globals is an old and removed feature of PHP, which automatically created variables from the incoming super globals, such as $_GET, $_POST, $_REQUEST, $_COOKIES. 

This meant that the initial set of variables in an application was not known, as they would depend on the incoming data. 

Register-globals has been removed in PHP 5.4. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   	// $_GET['foo'] = 'bar';
   	
   	echo $foo;
   ?>


`Documentation <https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Register_globals>`__

.. _regex:
.. _preg:

Regular Expressions
-------------------

A regular expression is a sequence of characters that specifies a search pattern. PHP currently uses the PCRE library, and used to have 2 such libraries. 

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
     preg_match('/(foo)(bar)(baz)/', 'foobarbaz', $matches, PREG_OFFSET_CAPTURE);
     print_r($matches);
   ?>


`Documentation <https://www.php.net/preg_match>`__

.. _rpc:

Remote Procedure Call
---------------------

RPC is an acronym for Remote Procedure Call. This happens when the program delegate the execution of a piece of code to a separate server.

PHP offers xml-rpc, grpc, protocolbuffers and yar offers different standard way to do RPC.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   $params = array ( one=>red,two=>blue,three=>green );
   
   $response = xmlrpc_encode ( $params );
   
   echo ( $response );
   ?>


`Documentation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call>`__

.. _reserved-name:

Reserved Names
--------------

PHP shares several namespaces with the users, and has reserved some names for its own usage. 

+ Namespaces : the global namespace, also known as ``\`` is reserved for PHP.
+ Keywords : `fn`, `finally`, `insteadof`, `null`, `void`, ...
+ classes, constants, functions, interfaces
+ variables : 



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // function void() would not compile
   function theVoid() : bool { }
   
   ?>

.. _resource:

resource
--------

A resource is a special type of data, holding a reference to an external resource. Resources are created and used by special functions. 

Resources are only used with their dedicated functions. It is not possible to modify them in any other way.

Resources, in general, are removed from PHP code and more recent version tend to rely less on them. 

There is a list of PHP resources : `List of Resource Types <https://www.php.net/manual/en/resource.php>`_.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $fp = fopen('/tmp/test.txt', 'r+');
   var_dump(is_resource($fp));
   
   ?>


`Documentation <https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.resource.php>`__

.. _return:

Return
------

`return` ends the current method, and sends back a produced value to the calling module. Execution resumes at the expression following the called module's invocation. 

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   function foo() {
       if (rand(0, 1)) {
           return 'tail';
       }
       
       return 'face';
   }
   
   echo foo();
   
   ?>

.. _returntypewillchange:

Return Type Will Change
-----------------------

This is a native PHP attribute, which tells the engine that method overwriting some native methods will change the returntype.

To avoid using that attribute, one must made the return type compatible with PHP signatures.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class Foo implements ArrayAccess {
       #[\ReturnTypeWillChange]
       public function offsetGet(mixed $offset) {}
       // ...
   }
   
   ?>

Added in PHP 8.1+

.. _return-typehint:
.. _returntype:

Return Typehint
---------------

Return typehints are the types used for the return values of a method or function. 

They are the same as the argument types, with a few addition : 

+ `void`, which means that no value is returned. (No usage of return, or return with no explicit value)
+ `never`, which means that the function won't return : either it will kill the application, or it will throw an exception.

Return types are ignored when the method throws an exception. 

return typehint are covariant : they get more or equally precise with each new child generation. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   function foo() : bool {
       if (rand(0,1)) {
           return true;
       } else {
           throw new Exception('e');
       }
   }
   
   ?>

.. _return-value:

Return Value
------------

Return value is the value returned, at the end of a method call. That value may be typed with a data typehint. It may also be typed with `never`, in case the method doesn't return, or `void`, when the method returns nothing. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   function foo() : int {
       return 1;
   }
   
   function goo() : never {
       throw new Exception(Error);
   }
   
   function hoo() : void {
       echo __METHOD__;
       // No return value
   }
   ?>

.. _sanitation:

Sanitation
----------

Sanitation is the process to clean data and remove any unwanted parts. The data may end up modified by this process, sometimes quite a lot. There are native and extension functions in PHP to perform sanitation, as long as components.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   echo 'TRANSLIT : ', iconv(UTF-8, ISO-8859-1//TRANSLIT, $text), PHP_EOL;

.. _sapi:

SAPI
----

Server Application Programming Interface : SAPI are the interface between PHP and a supporting platform, such as a web server (nginx, apache, caddy, ... ), a debugger (phpdbg, ...) or the command line interface (CLI).


.. code-block:: php

.. _scalar-typehint:
.. _scalar:

Scalar Typehints
----------------

In its simplest form, a yield statement looks much like a return statement, except that instead of stopping execution of the function and returning, yield instead provides a value to the code looping over the generator and pauses execution of the generator function. 

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   function gen_one_to_three() {
       for ($i = 1; $i <= 3; $i++) {
           // Note that $i is preserved between yields.
           yield $i;
       }
   }

.. _scope-resolution-operator:

Scope Resolution Operator
-------------------------

The Scope Resolution Operator is a token that allows access to static, constant, and overridden properties or methods of a class.

Traditionnally, this used to be a feature of the function get_class(). The operator is more modern and faster. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $a = new stdClass();
   
   echo $a::class;
   
   // identical to 
   echo get_class($a);

.. _self:

Self
----

Self is one of the three special keywords that are used to access properties or methods from inside the class definition. It relates to the current written class.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class X {
       private const X = 1;
       
       function foo() {
           // same as \X::C;
           return self::C;
       }

.. _semantics:

Semantics
---------

Semantics is related with the meaning of things. In particular, when naming structures, such as variables, classes, methods, properties, goto labels, use alias, functions or constants, the name should be meaningful. 

While naming doesn't impact the code itself, as names are free, they do have a serious impact on human understanding of the code. 

It is also possible to find inconsistencies between the name and its usage. For example, when a name is used for an unexepected type. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   function foo(User $commenter) { }
   
   // Inconsistence between the parameter name and its type
   function bar(array $string) { }
   
   ?>


.. _serialization:
.. _serialize:

Serialization
-------------

Serialization is a string representation of an object, that can be stored as text, and then turned into the original object again.

The reverse process is unserialization. 

In PHP, there are different ways to implement serialization. The native way is to rely on the serialize() and unserialize(), which, in turn, rely on the __serialize() and __unserialize() magic method. Then, var_export() and require() make another serialization method. WDDX, XML, JSON or YAML all work as serialization, yet they usually are not considered, over speed or performance issues. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class X {
       private const X = 1;
       
       function foo() {
           // same as \X::C;
           return self::C;
       }
   }
   
   ?>

.. _session:

Session
-------

Session support in PHP consists of a way to preserve certain data across subsequent accesses.

It relies on the ``session_*`` functions, and the ``$_SESSION`` superglobal variable.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   if (isset($_SESSION['x'])) {
       print x was already set with the value.$_SESSION['x'];
   }
   
   $_SESSION['x'] = rand(0, 10);
   print Giving the value.$_SESSION['x'].to x, in the session\n;
   
   ?>

.. _shallow-clone:

Shallow clone
-------------

A shallow clone is an object cloning, where the cloned object keeps the same object properties as the original object. This is a fast way to share data between objects.

Shallow cloning is the default behavior in PHP.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class Dog {
       private $name = '';
       private Address $address;
   
       function __construct(string $name, Address $address) {
           $this->address->setName($address);
       }
       
       function moves(string $address) {
           $this->address->setName($address);
       }
   
       // no __clone method
   }
   
   $spike = new Dog('Spike', new Address('Acme city'));
   $medor = clone $spike;
   $medor->moves('Upstate farm');
   
   // spike and medor are still at the same address
   
   ?>

.. _short-assignation:
.. _combined-operator:

Short assignations
------------------

In addition to the basic assignment operator, there are combined operators for all of the binary arithmetic, array union and string operators that allow you to use a value in an expression and then set its value to the result of that expression.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // incrementing $a by one
   $a = $a + 1;
   
   // short assignement for the above syntax
   $a += 1;
   
   ?>

Related : :ref:`assignation <assignation>`

.. _short-syntax:

Short Syntax
------------

A short syntax is the fusion of an operator with the `=` operator. That way, the operator is applied to the right hand operand, and the left variable, then, assigned to that variable. 

It is convenient when the variable has to be assigned again to itself.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $a = 0;
   // Adds 2 to $a
   $a = $a + 2;
   
   // short syntax to add 3 to $a
   $a += 3;
   
   ?>

.. _short-tag:

Short Tags
----------

PHP uses special tags to identify code that has to be executed. The short tags are a special set of PHP tag, shorter than the usual ``<?php``. It was simply ``<?``.

Short tags may be disabled in PHP configuration, with the ``short_open_tag`` directive. 

Short tags are different from echo tags : those tags immediately display data.

From the manual : As short tags can be disabled it is recommended to only use the normal tags (<?php ?> and <?= ?>) to maximise compatibility. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   echo 1;
   ?>
   
   <? 
   // this is a short tag
   echo 2;
   
   ?>

.. _shutdown-function:
.. _shutdown-handler:

Shutdown Function
-----------------

The shutdown function is a PHP custom function which is called when the application is shutting down. This is after a call to exit(), die() or the natural end of life of the script.

Multiple functions may be registered with the register_shutdown_function() function. They will be called in order of registration.

Shutdown function acts as destructors : they should clean up any unfinished jobs, and gracefully free resources, such as closing files with their correct endings, or gracefully closing connexions.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   // extract from the PHP manual
   function shutdown()
   {
       // This is our shutdown function, in 
       // here we can do any last operations
       // before the script is complete.
   
       echo 'Script executed with success', PHP_EOL;
   }
   
   register_shutdown_function('shutdown');
   ?>

.. _signature:

signature
---------

The signature of a method or a function is the list of arguments and constraints that applies when calling it. 

In its simplest form, signature of a method is its argument's type and list, though modern syntax should also include default values, visibilities and parameter names.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   function foo(string &$s = 'abc') {}
   ?>

.. _sql:

Simple Query Language (SQL)
---------------------------

Simple Query Language is a database query language, use to access and update data in a a relational database management system (RDBMS).

PHP supports several rdbms natively, such as : Mysql, Oracle, IBM db2, DBA, ODBC. PHP also offers a database abstraction layer, called PDO. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   mysqli_report(MYSQLI_REPORT_ERROR | MYSQLI_REPORT_STRICT);
   $mysqli = new mysqli("example.com", "user", "password", "database");

.. _simplexml:

SimpleXML
---------

The SimpleXML extension provides a very simple and easily usable toolset to convert XML to an object that can be processed with normal property selectors and array iterators.

   <?php
   $books = new SimpleXMLElement('<?xml version=1.0?>
   <books>

.. _single-quote:

Single Quotes Strings
---------------------

Single quoted strings are strings that include a literal value. 

This is an simpler version of the double-quoted strings. 

It is possible to include variables `$var`, single-dimension arrays `$array[1]` or `$array[index]`, and single-dereferencing object members `$object->member`. More complex expressions require usage of curly braces `{$}`, or the usage of the dot operator.

Double quoted strings use the anti-slash `\` to escape special characters, such as the anti-slash and the `$` sign.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // single quoted string : all literal values
   $name = 'elephpant loves $signs.'; 
   
   // double quoted string : variable value will be replaced at execution time.
   $greeting = "Hello! $name"; 
   
   // identical to
   $greeting = 'Hello! '.$name;

.. _singleton:

Singleton
---------

A singleton is a class which can only have one object. There is no way to instantiate the class and get a second, distinct object.

A singleton is used when there is a significant cost or limitations at maintaining multiple instances of the same object. For example, multiple Sqlite3 access to the same file, even as read-only, means several copies of the same file in memory. Or, several object referencing the same lock may be a problem.

Singleton are more difficult to test, as there is only one instance, and it is difficult to control it. Singleton may be achieve by dependency injection, with the same object. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
   // One method to build a singleton class
   class Singleton {
     private static self $instance = null;
     
     // The constructor is private, to avoid multiple instantiation
     // it is still accessible indirectly, via a public static method. 
     private function __construct()
     {
       // the usual constructo code
     }
   
     // the factory to build the singleton 
     public static function getInstance() : self {
       if (self::$instance === null) {
         self::$instance = new self;
       }
    
       return self::$instance;
     }

.. _sleep:

sleep
-----

sleep() is a PHP function which stops the execution for a given number of seconds. In web security, stopping a process makes it vulnerable to DOS attack : the process will wait, doing nothing yet using resources, allowing an attacker to saturate the server.

.. _sort:
.. _sorting:

Sort
----

Sorting is the action to put a list of object into a specific order. In PHP, sorting applies to arrays.

There are several ways to sort arrays in PHP: by value (no prefix), by key (`k` prefix), or by value while keeping the keys (`a` prefix, for associative). 

Then, the sort may be ascending (no prefix), descending (`r`, as in reverse) or custom (`u`, as in user sort). Custom sort is done with a closure or similar.

Based on the prefixes above, the following PHP native functions are available : sort(), rsort(), usort(), ksort(), krsort(), uksort(), asort(), uasort(). There is not ursort(), as the reverse part of the sort may be coded in the custom closure.

In case of ex-aequos while sorting, which are values with the same order, the values are sorted in the same order than the original array. This behavior has changed in PHP 7.0.

It is also possible to sort using a natural sort, which is a way to sort strings like a human would read them : natsort().

The default comparison between elements may be adapted with sort()'s parameter : regular, numeric, string, locale, natural and with or without case.  



.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php

.. _spaeceship:

Spaceship operator
------------------

Spaceship operator is an operator which reports if a value is larger, equal or smaller than another value. It return 1, 0 or -1 in each case, respectively. 

The spaceship operator may be replace by a `-` (minus) sign, if the compared values are correct. It may also be replace with `!=`, since -1 and 1 are both cast to `true`. 

The spaceship operator got its name from its resemblance to an flying saucer. Battleship operator, or death star operator do not exist.

Special Typehints
-----------------

PHP defines some special typehints.

+ mixed : any type
+ void : no returned value
+ callable : may be used as a callback
+ iterable : may be used with foreach(), including array
+ never : never returns
+ object : object of any class
+ parent : any of the parent class of the current class, excluding it
+ self : the current class
+ static : the current called class

Other special types are the scalar types.

.. _sqlite:

Sqlite3
-------

SQLite is a C-language library that implements a small, fast, self-contained, high-reliability, full-featured, SQL database engine.

The related extension is Sqlite3. It allows the creation and usage of file-based or memory-based databases.

Sqlite3 is also available with PDO (Portable Document File), with the pdo_sqlite engine.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   $db = new SQLite3('my.sqlite3');
   
   $results = $db->query('SELECT bar FROM foo');

.. _ssl:

SSL
---

SSL, the Secure Sockets Layer, is a cryptographic protocol designed to provide communications security over a computer network and on the Web. SSL is often related to HTTPS, for secured transmission with the HTTP protocol, although HTTPS has moved from SSL to TLS.

SSL is a PHP context for sockets, and share the configuration options with TLS.

.. _spl:

Standard PHP Library (SPL)
--------------------------

The Standard PHP Library (SPL) is a collection of interfaces and classes that are meant to solve common problems.

SPL offers features, functions, classes and interfaces in many different fields : iterators, data structures, files, exceptions, and observers. 

One of the most famous SPL features is the function spl_autoload_register(), which register an autoload handler.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // SPL and autoloading
   spl_autoload_register(function ($class) {
       include 'classes/' . $class . '.class.php';
   });
   
   if ($object instanceof Countable) {
       $count = count($object);
   } elseif ($object instanceof Traversable)
       $count = iterator_count($object);
   } else {

.. _static:

static
------

Static has many distinct usages.

Static is one of the three special keywords that are used to access properties or methods from inside the class definition. It relates to the current called class.

Static is a keyword for methods and properties : they are turned into class elements, and should be reached with the :: syntax, instead of -> or ?->.

Static is a keyword for closures and arrow functions : it prevents the current scope to be included in with the closure, thus limiting the number of accessible values.

Static is a keyword for variables : those variables aren't removed at the end of the method execution and are available at the beginning of the next call.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class X {
       private const X = 1;
       
       function foo() {
           return static::1;
   
           // same as \X::C; when the object is of class X
           // same as \Y::C; when the object is of class W
       }
   }
   
   class Y extends X {
       private const X = 2;
   }
   
   ?>

Static Method
-------------

Static methods are methods defined with the static keyword. They have to be called with the name of the class, rather than instantiated object. 

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class x {
       static function foo() {
           echo __METHOD__;
       }

.. _stdclass:

stdclass
--------

Stdclass is a native PHP class. It is the class used when a generic object is created, for example with json_decode() or the (object) cast operator.

The stdClass is allowed to create dynamic properties on the fly, as its base definition has none. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class X {
       private $property = 1;
       
       function foo() {

.. _strict-comparison:

Strict Comparison
-----------------

Strict comparison is a comparison operator or a control structure that checks not only the value but also the type of the value. In other words, it does not apply any type-juggling to the values before processing. 

Here are the strict operators : ``==`` may be replaced with ``===``,  ``!=`` may be replaced with ``!==``, ``switch`` may be replaced with ``match``, in_array() with the third parameter ``strict`` set to true. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   //true
   var_dump(1 == 1);
   //false
   var_dump(1 === 1);
   
   //true
   var_dump(null == 0);
   //false
   var_dump(null === 0);

strict_types
------------

strict_types is an execution directive, that makes PHP more strict when applying the typehints. In particular, it doesn't cast values automatically, but raise an error. 

``strict_types`` is an option per file, and is set with the declare() function.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   declare(strict_types=1);
   
   function foo(int $a) {}
   
   foo(1);
   foo(1.3);
   //Fatal error: Uncaught TypeError: foo(): Argument #1 ($a) must be of type int, float given,

.. _string:

String
------

A string is series of characters, where a character is the same as a byte. This means that PHP only supports a 256-character set, and hence does not offer native Unicode support. 

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $string = 'Hello world';
   
   ?>

.. _string-interpolation:

String Interpolation
--------------------

String interpolation is a feature where variables inside a string are dynamically replaced by their value at execution time. 

There are several ways to do interpolation : 

+ use double-quotes and a variable
+ use double-quotes and a property or a array with a valid index
+ use curly braces with a variable
+ use dollar and curly-braces : it calls the variable whose name is dynamically calculated in the curly braces. This syntax is deprecated in PHP 8.2 and later.

Double quotes and Heredoc notation allows string interpolation. On the other hand, single quote and nowdoc forbid interpolation. Then, escaping the special characters such as `$` and `{` with `\\` also disables interpolation locally.

Interpolation happens inside strings, while concatenation happens between strings.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $world = 'world';
   // This is an interpolated string
   $string = Hello $world;
   
   // This is not an interpolated string
   $string = 'Hollow $world';

.. _stringable:

Stringable
----------

The ``Stringable`` interface denotes a class as having a __toString() method. 

``Stringeable`` is not an English word : it is the name of this interface, and, at best, a neologism.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class x implements stringable {
       protected function __toString() : string {
           return 's';

.. _supply-chain-attack:

Supply Chain Attack
-------------------

Supply Chain Attack is a security attack that uses dependencies to infect a program.

Modern applications are built on top of components which are fetched from central repositories. In the PHP world, composer is the most popular PHP repository.

When those external repositories are infected with malicious component or code, the dependency manager loads them like the rest of the code. Blind trust in the imported code lead to vulnerabilities.

Switch Fallthrough
------------------

A fallthrough is the absence of break (or equivalent) at the end of a switch case. That way, the execution continues on the next case. 

While this is an intended feature, and is useful to reduce code, it tends to surprise programmers, which expect the cases to always end. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   switch ($a) {
       case 1:
           $a = 2 * $a;

Type Juggling
-------------

Type juggling is the emblematic PHP feature, where data has no specific type definition, and its type may change depending on the situation.

For example, integers are translated into string when displayed, or kept as integers to be used with math operations. 

Type juggling is usually done automatically, without user intervention. Explicit type juggling is achieved with the cast operators.

.. _underflow:

Underflow
---------

Underflow happens when a value goes below a limit : out of its range of existence, the behavior of the value is now unknown.

Underflow happens with integers (limited to PHP_INT_MAX  and PHP_INT_MIN), floats (PHP_FLOAT_MAX and PHP_FLOAT_MIN). 

Other situations, such as accessing an array element or a string character beyond its first element, defaults to returning `null`.

-------

Unicode is a standard to represent text. It is maintained by the Unicode Consortium. Unicode provides a widespread standard for characters. It is used everywhere, from computer to phones, online and offline.

Unicode moto : 'Everyone in the world should be able to use their own language on phones and computers.'

PHP supports unicode in its syntax with the declare() `encoding` option. 

PHP may translate from and to Unicode to other character sets with extensions such as iconv, intl, mbstring.

.. _url:

Universal Resource Locator (URL)
--------------------------------

Universal Resource Locator is a string that represents a resource, where to find it, how to access it. 

The full URL include the following information : 

+ protocol : for example, http, https, mongodb, zip
+ user : the username for authentication purposes
+ pass : the password associated with the username
+ server : the name or the address of the server where the resource reside
+ path : the location of the resource on the server
+ query : extra parameters to reach the resource
+ fragment : the location of the resource inside the previous address (server + path)

PHP has several functions dedicated to processing URL, such as parse_url() and http_build_query(). 

PHP also makes use of URL as a generalisation for file path. For example, file_get_contents() and fopen() both work on local and remote files, via URL.

PHP is able to process different protocols with its internal Protocols and Wrappers, using the file system functions.



.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
   
   print_r(parse_url('https://www.php.net/'));
   
   /*
   Array
   (
       [scheme] => https
       [host] => www.php.net
       [path] => /
   )
   */
   
   // fetch the PHP home page

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   $a = 1;
   echo foo($a);
   
   exit; 
   
   // This is unreachable code, as it will never be executed
   echo $a; 
   
   // This is not unreachable, as PHP scoops the definition at linting time
   function foo($s) {
   	return strtolower($s);
   }
   
   ?>


.. _unset:

unset Keyword
-------------

unset() removes a variable. This features used to be available as a function call `unset()` or as a type cast `(unset)`. The type-cast was removed in PHP 7.2

   <?php
   
   $a = 1;
   unset($a);

.. _unserialization:
.. _unserialize:

Unsserialization
----------------

Unserialization is the extraction of an object from a string representation of an object.

The reverse process is serialization. 

In PHP, there are different ways to implement serialization. The native way is to rely on the serialize() and unserialize(), which, in turn, rely on the __serialize() and __unserialize() magic method. Then, var_export() and require() make another serialization method. WDDX, XML, JSON or YAML all work as serialization, yet they usually are not considered, over speed or performance issues. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   class X {
       private const X = 1;
       
       function foo() {
           // same as \X::C;
           return self::C;
       }
   }

.. _unused:

Unused
------

Unused is a state of a PHP structure. It has been declared, defined or created, but it is used. This is characteristics of dead code.

Being unused happens to constants, variables, parameters, properties, methods, classes, traits, interfaces, use expression. 

It also happens to propagate : removing an unused function may actually create another unused function, which was only called by the first one. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   const A = 1;
   const B = 2;
   
   echo A;
   
   // B is defined but not used

.. _use:

Use
---

The use operator has three distinct usage. 

The use operator allows the import and aliasing of fully qualified names (such as classes, interfaces, constants, ...)  in the current namespace. 

When `use` used inside a class or a trait, it imports a trait and its methods and properties. 

When `use` is used with a closure, it imports the listed variables in the closure, from the defining environment. 

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   namespace \My\Space {
       // class importation with use
       use \Some\Other\Space\aClass as A;
       
       class B {
           // trait importation of use
           use MyTrait; 
       
           function foo() {
               $a = 1;
               // use imports the variable $a in the closure. Its value is accessible at execution time.
               $closure = function ($b) use ($a) { return $a + $b;}
           }
       }
       // class importation with use

.. _uuid:

UUID
----

UUID is a universally unique identifier. It is an identifier that anyone can generate, and that has a near certainty that it identify something unique in the universe. 

UUID are in constrast to classic integer ids, such as auto-increment primary keys, which usually start at 0, and are incrementally generated. Not only this means connecting to a database, and querying the right table, but also means that there are multiple usage of 1, in each of these tables.

UUID are a standard. The standard has versions from 1 to 5, each with improvements.

.. _variable-argument:

Variable Arguments
------------------

Variable arguments refers to a methodcall where the list of argument is depends on the call, rather than the signature of the method.

Variable arguments are achieved with the variadic operator, or with the func_get_args() functions. Variadic operator covers most of the cases, and func_get_args() covers the remaining edge cases. 

Variable arguments may be static or dynamic. It is static when the list of arguments varies from call to call, and are hard-coded. Dynamic argument list depends on variadic operator, or call_user_func_array() functions.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // No arguments in the signature.
   function foo() {
   	// displays the list of arguments
   	print_r(func_get_args());
   }
   
   // static arguments
   foo(1, 2);
   foo(4, 5, 6);
   
   // dynamic variable arguments
   $args = range(5, rand(9, 11)) ; 
   foo(...$args);

Variable Scope
--------------

Variable scope is the context in which the variable is available. The context is often one method or function. 

``global`` keywords allows variables from other contextes to be available in the current one. 

Local variables are only available in one method or function, not counting the local or bind closures or arrow functions. 


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   function foo() {
   	// $a is only available in foo
   	$a = 1;
   }

.. _variable_order:

variable_order
--------------

The `variable_order` directive sets the order in which the values are aassigned to the `$_REQUEST` variable.

The default is `EGPCS` : Environment, GET, POST, COOKIE and SESSION. The values are overwritten by the next, so if GET and POST have both an `x` variable, the default configuration will only keep the one from POST, as it is later in the configuration. 

The default configuration ensures that safer values, such as the session's value, are not overwritten by less safe values from GET or POST, for example.



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // variable_order = EGPCS

Wrapper
-------

A Wrapper is a custom way to access remote resources. It is designed to look like accessing to file, on the file system, but using other drivers than the ones of the hard drive. It is based on a configuration string, which looks like a URL : `ftp://www.site.com/file.txt`, where the part before the `://` is the protocol.

Among the predefined PHP wrapper, there are http://, ftp://, zlib://, phar://, rar://, expect://. 

A wrapper is also a design pattern, also called an adapter. This concept also appears when a component provide access to a remote service : it is a PHP wrapper (wrapper for the service when calling PHP) or a `service-name` wrapper, when it is viewed from PHP.

.. _xmlwriter:

XMLwriter
---------

This is the XMLWriter extension. It wraps the libxml xmlWriter API.

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // adapted from PHP Manual
   
   $xw = xmlwriter_open_memory();
   xmlwriter_set_indent($xw, 1);
   $res = xmlwriter_set_indent_string($xw, ' ');
   
   xmlwriter_start_document($xw, '1.0', 'UTF-8');
   
   // A first element
   xmlwriter_start_element($xw, 'tag1');
   
   // Attribute 'att1' for element 'tag1'
   xmlwriter_start_attribute($xw, 'att1');
   xmlwriter_text($xw, 'valueofatt1');
   xmlwriter_end_attribute($xw);

.. _xxtea:

XXTEA
-----

XXTea is a block cipher algorithm.

.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
   $str = "Hello World! 你好，中国🇨🇳！";
   $key = "1234567890";
   $base64 = "D4t0rVXUDl3bnWdERhqJmFIanfn/6zAxAY9jD6n9MSMQNoD8TOS4rHHcGuE=";
   $encrypt_data = xxtea_encrypt($str, $key);
   $decrypt_data = xxtea_decrypt($encrypt_data, $key);
   if ($str == $decrypt_data && base64_encode($encrypt_data) == $base64) {
       echo "success!";
   } else {
       echo base64_encode($encrypt_data);
       echo "fail!";
   }
   ?>

.. _yield:

Yield
-----

In its simplest form, a yield statement looks much like a return statement, except that instead of stopping execution of the function and returning, yield instead provides a value to the code looping over the generator and pauses execution of the generator function. 

.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   function gen_one_to_three() {
       for ($i = 1; $i <= 3; $i++) {
           // Note that $i is preserved between yields.
           yield $i;
       }
   }
   
   ?>

.. _yield-from:

yield from Keyword
------------------

Generator delegation allows you to yield values from another generator, Traversable object, or array by using the yield from keyword.

.. code-block:: php
   
   
   <?php
   function inner() {
       yield 1; // key 0
       yield 2; // key 1
       yield 3; // key 2
   }
   function gen() {
       yield 0; // key 0
       yield from inner(); // keys 0-2
       yield 4; // key 1
   }
   // pass false as second parameter to get an array [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
   var_dump(iterator_to_array(gen()));
   ?>

.. _yoda:

Yoda condition
--------------

Yoda condition is a way to write condition by using any literal value on the left, instead of the right.

This prevents errors where the comparison operator is shortened, and turned into an assignation, which is usually true. 



.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // Yoda condition
   if (0 == $a) {}
   
   // Assignation, instead of comparison and bug
   if ($a = 0) {}
   
   ?>

.. _zval:

Zval
----

ZVAL is a C structure, that represents data in PHP. It is a C structure, which is never directly used from PHP code.

It may be access with debug_zval_dump() function. It is useful to debug PHP engine, or extensions.


.. code-block:: php
   
   <?php
   
   // From the manual 
   $var1 = 'Hello';
   $var1 .= ' World';
   $var2 = $var1;
   
   debug_zval_dump($var1);
   
   // displays string(11) Hello World refcount(3)
   
   ?>
